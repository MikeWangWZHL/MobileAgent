FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

We extract the keyboard status of the current screenshot and it is whether the keyboard of the current screenshot is activated.
The keyboard status is as follow:
The keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.

### Hint ###
There are hints to help you complete the user's instructions. The hints are as follow:
0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.
1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.
2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.
3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.


### Response requirements ###
Now you need to combine all of the above to perform just one action on the current page. You must choose one of the six actions below:
Open_App (app name): If the current page is desktop, you can use this action to open the app named "app name" on the desktop.
Tap (x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current page.
Swipe (x1, y1), (x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2).
Unable to Type. You cannot use the actions involving "Type" because the keyboard has not been activated. If you want to type, please first activate the keyboard by tapping on the input box on the screen.
Enter: Press the Enter key.
Switch_App: Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.
Back: Return to the previous state.
Home: Return to home page.
Wait: Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.

### Output format ###
Your output consists of the following three parts:
### Thought ###
Think step by step: check what has been completed and what still needs to be done. Before deciding to stop, put yourself in the user's shoes to ensure satisfaction with the current status. Make sure you have explored sufficiently if the situation implies further investigation.
### Action ###
You can only choose one from the six actions above. Make sure that the coordinates or text in the "()".
### Operation ###
Please generate a brief natural language description for the operation in Action based on your Thought.
