If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The current screen shows the \"For you\" section of the X app. No specific trending topics are visible yet, but the following posts are present:   - A post by @elonmusk showing a rocket launch with significant engagement (16K comments, 49.6K retweets, 499K likes, 82.2M views).   - A post by @Vinod_r108 titled \"Thread of Heart-Breaking Moments Right Before Disaster Strikes,\" with a warning for sensitive viewers.  No clear trending topics have been identified yet.\n\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded. The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here. Otherwise, keep the current plan and copy it here.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nThe next subgoal to work on. If the previous subgoal is not yet complete, copy it here. If all subgoals are completed, write \"Finished\".\n",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screen still displays posts from the \"For You\" feed, and there is no indication that the \"Trending\" section has been accessed.\n- Attempt 4: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 53, 'y': 1849}} | Description: This action will tap on the icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen, which appears to be a menu or navigation button. This is likely to provide access to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action tapped on the bottom-left icon, which was expected to navigate to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. However, the resulting screen is the profile page of @POTUS, indicating that the action did not lead to the intended destination. This could be due to the icon being misidentified or the app's interface behaving differently than expected.\n- Attempt 5: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 263, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the second icon from the left in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Explore\" or \"Trending\" section. This is expected to display trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to navigate to the \"Trending\" section by tapping the second icon in the bottom navigation bar. However, the resulting screen shows the app switcher or recent apps menu instead of the \"Trending\" section. This indicates that the tap action was misdirected, possibly due to an incorrect tap location or a misinterpretation of the interface.\n- Attempt 6: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the center icon in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section.

If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The next step is to navigate to the \"Trending\" section to identify the top 3 trending news topics. ### Suggested Next Step ### Return to the X app by tapping its icon on the home screen and attempt to access the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section again.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\n### Thought ### The current plan to access the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section on the X app has encountered repeated failures. The actions taken so far have not successfully navigated to the desired section, and the current screen still displays the \"For You\" feed. The interface of the app may have changed, or the navigation method may need to be adjusted. A revised approach is necessary to resolve the issue. ### Plan ### 1. Open the X app and navigate to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section using alternative methods, such as the search bar or other navigation options. 2. Identify the top 3 trending news topics. 3. Read and summarize the key points of the top 3 trending topics. 4. Open the Notes app and create a new note. 5. Write the summaries of the top 3 trending topics in the new note. ### Updated Subgoal ### 1. Use the search bar in the X app to search for \"Trending\" or \"Top News\" to locate the trending topics. If this fails, explore other navigation options within the app.\n\n---\nThe attached two images are two phone screenshots before and after your last action.

No clear trending topics have been identified yet.\n\n### Stuck with Errors! ###\nYou have encountered some errors that has not been resolved for three consecutive attempts. Here are some logs:\n- Attempt 1: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 1622}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"X\" app icon to open it, allowing access to the \"Trending\" section to identify the top 3 trending news topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 2: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 968, 'y': 2102}} | Description: This action will tap the \"OK\" button to dismiss the notification, allowing me to proceed with navigating to the \"Trending\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 3: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to load more content, potentially revealing trending topics or a \"Trending\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not reveal the \"Trending\" section or any new content related to trending topics. The screen still displays posts from the \"For You\" feed, and there is no indication that the \"Trending\" section has been accessed.\n- Attempt 4: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 53, 'y': 1849}} | Description: This action will tap on the icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen, which appears to be a menu or navigation button. This is likely to provide access to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action tapped on the bottom-left icon, which was expected to navigate to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. However, the resulting screen is the profile page of @POTUS, indicating that the action did not lead to the intended destination. This could be due to the icon being misidentified or the app's interface behaving differently than expected.\n- Attempt 5: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 263, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the second icon from the left in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Explore\" or \"Trending\" section. This is expected to display trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to navigate to the \"Trending\" section by tapping the second icon in the bottom navigation bar. However, the resulting screen shows the app switcher or recent apps menu instead of the \"Trending\" section. This indicates that the tap action was misdirected, possibly due to an incorrect tap location or a misinterpretation of the interface.\n- Attempt 6: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the center icon in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. This is expected to display trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping the center icon in the bottom navigation bar did not lead to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. Instead, it returned to the home screen of the device, as indicated by the presence of app icons like \"Settings,\" \"Notes,\" and \"X\" on the screen. The potential reason for this failure could be that the center icon in the bottom navigation bar was not associated with the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section but instead acted as a \"Home\" button, taking the user to the device's home screen.\n- Attempt 7: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 263, 'y': 44}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar located at the top of the screen. This will allow me to type a query to locate the \"Trending\" or \"Top News\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping on the search bar did not occur as expected. Instead, the app was exited, and the device returned to the home screen. This indicates that the tap action was either misaligned or misinterpreted, leading to the app being closed rather than interacting with the search bar.\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Here are some logs:\n- Attempt 1: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 1622}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"X\" app icon to open it, allowing access to the \"Trending\" section to identify the top 3 trending news topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 2: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 968, 'y': 2102}} | Description: This action will tap the \"OK\" button to dismiss the notification, allowing me to proceed with navigating to the \"Trending\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 3: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to load more content, potentially revealing trending topics or a \"Trending\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not reveal the \"Trending\" section or any new content related to trending topics. The screen still displays posts from the \"For You\" feed, and there is no indication that the \"Trending\" section has been accessed.\n- Attempt 4: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 53, 'y': 1849}} | Description: This action will tap on the icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen, which appears to be a menu or navigation button. This is likely to provide access to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action tapped on the bottom-left icon, which was expected to navigate to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. However, the resulting screen is the profile page of @POTUS, indicating that the action did not lead to the intended destination. This could be due to the icon being misidentified or the app's interface behaving differently than expected.\n- Attempt 5: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 263, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the second icon from the left in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Explore\" or \"Trending\" section. This is expected to display trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to navigate to the \"Trending\" section by tapping the second icon in the bottom navigation bar. However, the resulting screen shows the app switcher or recent apps menu instead of the \"Trending\" section. This indicates that the tap action was misdirected, possibly due to an incorrect tap location or a misinterpretation of the interface.\n- Attempt 6: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the center icon in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. This is expected to display trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping the center icon in the bottom navigation bar did not lead to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. Instead, it returned to the home screen of the device, as indicated by the presence of app icons like \"Settings,\" \"Notes,\" and \"X\" on the screen. The potential reason for this failure could be that the center icon in the bottom navigation bar was not associated with the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section but instead acted as a \"Home\" button, taking the user to the device's home screen.\n- Attempt 7: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 263, 'y': 44}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar located at the top of the screen. This will allow me to type a query to locate the \"Trending\" or \"Top News\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping on the search bar did not occur as expected. Instead, the app was exited, and the device returned to the home screen. This indicates that the tap action was either misaligned or misinterpreted, leading to the app being closed rather than interacting with the search bar.\n- Attempt 8: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to load more content, potentially revealing additional posts with high engagement to identify a third trending topic. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app. Instead, it navigated to the device's search interface, which is unrelated to the task of identifying trending topics on X.

If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

No clear trending topics have been identified yet.\n\n### Stuck with Errors! ###\nYou have encountered some errors that has not been resolved for three consecutive attempts. Here are some logs:\n- Attempt 1: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 1622}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"X\" app icon to open it, allowing access to the \"Trending\" section to identify the top 3 trending news topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 2: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 968, 'y': 2102}} | Description: This action will tap the \"OK\" button to dismiss the notification, allowing me to proceed with navigating to the \"Trending\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 3: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to load more content, potentially revealing trending topics or a \"Trending\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not reveal the \"Trending\" section or any new content related to trending topics. The screen still displays posts from the \"For You\" feed, and there is no indication that the \"Trending\" section has been accessed.\n- Attempt 4: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 53, 'y': 1849}} | Description: This action will tap on the icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen, which appears to be a menu or navigation button. This is likely to provide access to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action tapped on the bottom-left icon, which was expected to navigate to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. However, the resulting screen is the profile page of @POTUS, indicating that the action did not lead to the intended destination. This could be due to the icon being misidentified or the app's interface behaving differently than expected.\n- Attempt 5: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 263, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the second icon from the left in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Explore\" or \"Trending\" section. This is expected to display trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to navigate to the \"Trending\" section by tapping the second icon in the bottom navigation bar. However, the resulting screen shows the app switcher or recent apps menu instead of the \"Trending\" section. This indicates that the tap action was misdirected, possibly due to an incorrect tap location or a misinterpretation of the interface.\n- Attempt 6: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the center icon in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. This is expected to display trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping the center icon in the bottom navigation bar did not lead to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. Instead, it returned to the home screen of the device, as indicated by the presence of app icons like \"Settings,\" \"Notes,\" and \"X\" on the screen. The potential reason for this failure could be that the center icon in the bottom navigation bar was not associated with the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section but instead acted as a \"Home\" button, taking the user to the device's home screen.\n- Attempt 7: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 263, 'y': 44}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar located at the top of the screen. This will allow me to type a query to locate the \"Trending\" or \"Top News\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping on the search bar did not occur as expected. Instead, the app was exited, and the device returned to the home screen. This indicates that the tap action was either misaligned or misinterpreted, leading to the app being closed rather than interacting with the search bar.\n- Attempt 8: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to load more content, potentially revealing additional posts with high engagement to identify a third trending topic. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app. Instead, it navigated to the device's search interface, which is unrelated to the task of identifying trending topics on X. This indicates that the swipe gesture was either misinterpreted or performed outside the X app.\n- Attempt 9: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to load more content in the \"For You\" feed, allowing me to identify additional trending topics. This action is expected to reveal more posts with high engagement. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app. Instead, it navigated to the device's search interface, which is unrelated to the task of identifying trending topics on X. This could have been caused by an unintended gesture or a misinterpretation of the swipe action.\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded. The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed.

If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

No clear trending topics have been identified yet.\n\n### Stuck with Errors! ###\nYou have encountered some errors that has not been resolved for three consecutive attempts. Here are some logs:\n- Attempt 1: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 1622}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"X\" app icon to open it, allowing access to the \"Trending\" section to identify the top 3 trending news topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 2: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 968, 'y': 2102}} | Description: This action will tap the \"OK\" button to dismiss the notification, allowing me to proceed with navigating to the \"Trending\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 3: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to load more content, potentially revealing trending topics or a \"Trending\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not reveal the \"Trending\" section or any new content related to trending topics. The screen still displays posts from the \"For You\" feed, and there is no indication that the \"Trending\" section has been accessed.\n- Attempt 4: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 53, 'y': 1849}} | Description: This action will tap on the icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen, which appears to be a menu or navigation button. This is likely to provide access to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action tapped on the bottom-left icon, which was expected to navigate to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. However, the resulting screen is the profile page of @POTUS, indicating that the action did not lead to the intended destination. This could be due to the icon being misidentified or the app's interface behaving differently than expected.\n- Attempt 5: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 263, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the second icon from the left in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Explore\" or \"Trending\" section. This is expected to display trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to navigate to the \"Trending\" section by tapping the second icon in the bottom navigation bar. However, the resulting screen shows the app switcher or recent apps menu instead of the \"Trending\" section. This indicates that the tap action was misdirected, possibly due to an incorrect tap location or a misinterpretation of the interface.\n- Attempt 6: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the center icon in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. This is expected to display trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping the center icon in the bottom navigation bar did not lead to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. Instead, it returned to the home screen of the device, as indicated by the presence of app icons like \"Settings,\" \"Notes,\" and \"X\" on the screen. The potential reason for this failure could be that the center icon in the bottom navigation bar was not associated with the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section but instead acted as a \"Home\" button, taking the user to the device's home screen.\n- Attempt 7: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 263, 'y': 44}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar located at the top of the screen. This will allow me to type a query to locate the \"Trending\" or \"Top News\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping on the search bar did not occur as expected. Instead, the app was exited, and the device returned to the home screen. This indicates that the tap action was either misaligned or misinterpreted, leading to the app being closed rather than interacting with the search bar.\n- Attempt 8: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to load more content, potentially revealing additional posts with high engagement to identify a third trending topic. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app. Instead, it navigated to the device's search interface, which is unrelated to the task of identifying trending topics on X. This indicates that the swipe gesture was either misinterpreted or performed outside the X app.\n- Attempt 9: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to load more content in the \"For You\" feed, allowing me to identify additional trending topics. This action is expected to reveal more posts with high engagement. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app. Instead, it navigated to the device's search interface, which is unrelated to the task of identifying trending topics on X. This could have been caused by an unintended gesture or a misinterpretation of the swipe action.\n- Attempt 10: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to load more content in the \"For You\" feed, allowing me to identify the third trending topic. This action is expected to reveal additional posts with high engagement. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action intended to load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app instead navigated to the device's search screen. This indicates that the swipe gesture was misinterpreted as a system-level action rather than an in-app action. This could be due to swiping too close to the edge of the screen or an unintentional gesture.\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded.

This could be due to swiping too close to the edge of the screen or an unintentional gesture.\n\nNOTE: Since the last action failed and resulted in an incorrect page, I have reverted the phone state to its previous state for you.\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

No clear trending topics have been identified yet.\n\n### Stuck with Errors! ###\nYou have encountered some errors that has not been resolved for three consecutive attempts. Here are some logs:\n- Attempt 1: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 1622}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"X\" app icon to open it, allowing access to the \"Trending\" section to identify the top 3 trending news topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 2: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 968, 'y': 2102}} | Description: This action will tap the \"OK\" button to dismiss the notification, allowing me to proceed with navigating to the \"Trending\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 3: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to load more content, potentially revealing trending topics or a \"Trending\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not reveal the \"Trending\" section or any new content related to trending topics. The screen still displays posts from the \"For You\" feed, and there is no indication that the \"Trending\" section has been accessed.\n- Attempt 4: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 53, 'y': 1849}} | Description: This action will tap on the icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen, which appears to be a menu or navigation button. This is likely to provide access to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action tapped on the bottom-left icon, which was expected to navigate to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. However, the resulting screen is the profile page of @POTUS, indicating that the action did not lead to the intended destination. This could be due to the icon being misidentified or the app's interface behaving differently than expected.\n- Attempt 5: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 263, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the second icon from the left in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Explore\" or \"Trending\" section. This is expected to display trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to navigate to the \"Trending\" section by tapping the second icon in the bottom navigation bar. However, the resulting screen shows the app switcher or recent apps menu instead of the \"Trending\" section. This indicates that the tap action was misdirected, possibly due to an incorrect tap location or a misinterpretation of the interface.\n- Attempt 6: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the center icon in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. This is expected to display trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping the center icon in the bottom navigation bar did not lead to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. Instead, it returned to the home screen of the device, as indicated by the presence of app icons like \"Settings,\" \"Notes,\" and \"X\" on the screen. The potential reason for this failure could be that the center icon in the bottom navigation bar was not associated with the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section but instead acted as a \"Home\" button, taking the user to the device's home screen.\n- Attempt 7: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 263, 'y': 44}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar located at the top of the screen. This will allow me to type a query to locate the \"Trending\" or \"Top News\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping on the search bar did not occur as expected. Instead, the app was exited, and the device returned to the home screen. This indicates that the tap action was either misaligned or misinterpreted, leading to the app being closed rather than interacting with the search bar.\n- Attempt 8: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to load more content, potentially revealing additional posts with high engagement to identify a third trending topic. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app. Instead, it navigated to the device's search interface, which is unrelated to the task of identifying trending topics on X. This indicates that the swipe gesture was either misinterpreted or performed outside the X app.\n- Attempt 9: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to load more content in the \"For You\" feed, allowing me to identify additional trending topics. This action is expected to reveal more posts with high engagement. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app. Instead, it navigated to the device's search interface, which is unrelated to the task of identifying trending topics on X. This could have been caused by an unintended gesture or a misinterpretation of the swipe action.\n- Attempt 10: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to load more content in the \"For You\" feed, allowing me to identify the third trending topic. This action is expected to reveal additional posts with high engagement. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action intended to load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app instead navigated to the device's search screen. This indicates that the swipe gesture was misinterpreted as a system-level action rather than an in-app action. This could be due to swiping too close to the edge of the screen or an unintentional gesture.\n- Attempt 11: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to load more content in the \"For You\" feed, allowing me to identify additional trending topics. This action is expected to reveal more posts with high engagement. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action intended to load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app instead navigated to the device's search interface. This indicates that the swipe gesture was misinterpreted as a system-level action rather than an in-app action. This could be due to swiping from a location that triggered the system's search functionality instead of interacting with the app.\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded.

This indicates that the swipe gesture was misinterpreted as a system-level action rather than an in-app action. This could be due to swiping too close to the edge of the screen or an unintentional gesture.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to load more content in the \"For You\" feed, allowing me to identify additional trending topics.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

No clear trending topics have been identified yet.\n\n### Stuck with Errors! ###\nYou have encountered some errors that has not been resolved for three consecutive attempts. Here are some logs:\n- Attempt 1: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 1622}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"X\" app icon to open it, allowing access to the \"Trending\" section to identify the top 3 trending news topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 2: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 968, 'y': 2102}} | Description: This action will tap the \"OK\" button to dismiss the notification, allowing me to proceed with navigating to the \"Trending\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 3: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to load more content, potentially revealing trending topics or a \"Trending\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not reveal the \"Trending\" section or any new content related to trending topics. The screen still displays posts from the \"For You\" feed, and there is no indication that the \"Trending\" section has been accessed.\n- Attempt 4: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 53, 'y': 1849}} | Description: This action will tap on the icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen, which appears to be a menu or navigation button. This is likely to provide access to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action tapped on the bottom-left icon, which was expected to navigate to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. However, the resulting screen is the profile page of @POTUS, indicating that the action did not lead to the intended destination. This could be due to the icon being misidentified or the app's interface behaving differently than expected.\n- Attempt 5: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 263, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the second icon from the left in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Explore\" or \"Trending\" section. This is expected to display trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to navigate to the \"Trending\" section by tapping the second icon in the bottom navigation bar. However, the resulting screen shows the app switcher or recent apps menu instead of the \"Trending\" section. This indicates that the tap action was misdirected, possibly due to an incorrect tap location or a misinterpretation of the interface.\n- Attempt 6: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the center icon in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. This is expected to display trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping the center icon in the bottom navigation bar did not lead to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. Instead, it returned to the home screen of the device, as indicated by the presence of app icons like \"Settings,\" \"Notes,\" and \"X\" on the screen. The potential reason for this failure could be that the center icon in the bottom navigation bar was not associated with the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section but instead acted as a \"Home\" button, taking the user to the device's home screen.\n- Attempt 7: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 263, 'y': 44}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar located at the top of the screen. This will allow me to type a query to locate the \"Trending\" or \"Top News\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping on the search bar did not occur as expected. Instead, the app was exited, and the device returned to the home screen. This indicates that the tap action was either misaligned or misinterpreted, leading to the app being closed rather than interacting with the search bar.\n- Attempt 8: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to load more content, potentially revealing additional posts with high engagement to identify a third trending topic. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app. Instead, it navigated to the device's search interface, which is unrelated to the task of identifying trending topics on X. This indicates that the swipe gesture was either misinterpreted or performed outside the X app.\n- Attempt 9: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to load more content in the \"For You\" feed, allowing me to identify additional trending topics. This action is expected to reveal more posts with high engagement. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app. Instead, it navigated to the device's search interface, which is unrelated to the task of identifying trending topics on X. This could have been caused by an unintended gesture or a misinterpretation of the swipe action.\n- Attempt 10: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to load more content in the \"For You\" feed, allowing me to identify the third trending topic. This action is expected to reveal additional posts with high engagement. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action intended to load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app instead navigated to the device's search screen. This indicates that the swipe gesture was misinterpreted as a system-level action rather than an in-app action. This could be due to swiping too close to the edge of the screen or an unintentional gesture.\n- Attempt 11: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to load more content in the \"For You\" feed, allowing me to identify additional trending topics. This action is expected to reveal more posts with high engagement. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action intended to load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app instead navigated to the device's search interface. This indicates that the swipe gesture was misinterpreted as a system-level action rather than an in-app action. This could be due to swiping from a location that triggered the system's search functionality instead of interacting with the app.\n- Attempt 12: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1800, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 600}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to load more content in the \"For You\" feed, allowing me to identify additional trending topics. The swipe is adjusted to avoid triggering system-level gestures. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app. Instead, it navigated to the device's search interface, which is unrelated to the task of identifying trending topics on X. This could have been caused by an unintended gesture or a misinterpretation of the swipe action.\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Here are some logs:\n- Attempt 1: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 1622}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"X\" app icon to open it, allowing access to the \"Trending\" section to identify the top 3 trending news topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 2: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 968, 'y': 2102}} | Description: This action will tap the \"OK\" button to dismiss the notification, allowing me to proceed with navigating to the \"Trending\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 3: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to load more content, potentially revealing trending topics or a \"Trending\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not reveal the \"Trending\" section or any new content related to trending topics. The screen still displays posts from the \"For You\" feed, and there is no indication that the \"Trending\" section has been accessed.\n- Attempt 4: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 53, 'y': 1849}} | Description: This action will tap on the icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen, which appears to be a menu or navigation button. This is likely to provide access to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action tapped on the bottom-left icon, which was expected to navigate to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. However, the resulting screen is the profile page of @POTUS, indicating that the action did not lead to the intended destination. This could be due to the icon being misidentified or the app's interface behaving differently than expected.\n- Attempt 5: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 263, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the second icon from the left in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Explore\" or \"Trending\" section. This is expected to display trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to navigate to the \"Trending\" section by tapping the second icon in the bottom navigation bar. However, the resulting screen shows the app switcher or recent apps menu instead of the \"Trending\" section. This indicates that the tap action was misdirected, possibly due to an incorrect tap location or a misinterpretation of the interface.\n- Attempt 6: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2272}} | Description: This action will tap the center icon in the bottom navigation bar, which is likely to lead to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. This is expected to display trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping the center icon in the bottom navigation bar did not lead to the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section. Instead, it returned to the home screen of the device, as indicated by the presence of app icons like \"Settings,\" \"Notes,\" and \"X\" on the screen. The potential reason for this failure could be that the center icon in the bottom navigation bar was not associated with the \"Trending\" or \"Explore\" section but instead acted as a \"Home\" button, taking the user to the device's home screen.\n- Attempt 7: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 263, 'y': 44}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar located at the top of the screen. This will allow me to type a query to locate the \"Trending\" or \"Top News\" section. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping on the search bar did not occur as expected. Instead, the app was exited, and the device returned to the home screen. This indicates that the tap action was either misaligned or misinterpreted, leading to the app being closed rather than interacting with the search bar.\n- Attempt 8: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to load more content, potentially revealing additional posts with high engagement to identify a third trending topic. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app. Instead, it navigated to the device's search interface, which is unrelated to the task of identifying trending topics on X. This indicates that the swipe gesture was either misinterpreted or performed outside the X app.\n- Attempt 9: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to load more content in the \"For You\" feed, allowing me to identify additional trending topics. This action is expected to reveal more posts with high engagement. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app. Instead, it navigated to the device's search interface, which is unrelated to the task of identifying trending topics on X. This could have been caused by an unintended gesture or a misinterpretation of the swipe action.\n- Attempt 10: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to load more content in the \"For You\" feed, allowing me to identify the third trending topic. This action is expected to reveal additional posts with high engagement. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action intended to load more content in the \"For You\" feed on the X app instead navigated to the device's search screen. This indicates that the swipe gesture was misinterpreted as a system-level action rather than an in-app action. This could be due to swiping too close to the edge of the screen or an unintentional gesture.\n- Attempt 11: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to load more content in the \"For You\" feed, allowing me to identify additional trending topics.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",
