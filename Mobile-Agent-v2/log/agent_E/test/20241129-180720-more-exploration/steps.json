You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n1. If you want to tap an icon of an app, use the action \"Open_App\". \n2. If you want to exit an app, use the action \"Home\".\n\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options above. Be sure to fill in all required arguments, such as text and coordinates (e.g., x and y), in the provided fields.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you want to tap an icon of an app, use the action \"Open_App\". 2. If you want to exit an app, use the action \"Home\". 3. When searching for information or performing a query in an app, use the \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\" shortcut if a text input box is present. This consolidates tapping, typing, and submitting into a single action, improving efficiency.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options above. Be sure to fill in all required arguments, such as text and coordinates (e.g., x and y), in the provided fields.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n1. If you want to tap an icon of an app, use the action \"Open_App\".  2. If you want to exit an app, use the action \"Home\".  3. When searching for information or performing a query in an app, use the \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\" shortcut if a text input box is present. This consolidates tapping, typing, and submitting into a single action, improving efficiency.  4. When performing a search in an app, ensure that the search query is specific enough to minimize irrelevant results. This can save time when reviewing the results.  5. If multiple steps are required to gather information (e.g., comparing details of two restaurants), plan the sequence of actions carefully to avoid unnecessary app switching or redundant searches.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options above. Be sure to fill in all required arguments, such as text and coordinates (e.g., x and y), in the provided fields.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you want to tap an icon of an app, use the action \"Open_App\".  2. If you want to exit an app, use the action \"Home\".  3. When searching for information or performing a query in an app, use the \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\" shortcut if a text input box is present. This consolidates tapping, typing, and submitting into a single action, improving efficiency.  4. When performing a search in an app, ensure that the search query is specific enough to minimize irrelevant results. This can save time when reviewing the results.  5. If multiple steps are required to gather information (e.g., comparing details of two restaurants), plan the sequence of actions carefully to avoid unnecessary app switching or redundant searches.  6. When reviewing search results in an app, prioritize tapping on entries that are most likely to meet the task's criteria based on visible information (e.g., ratings, distance, or hours). This can reduce the need to open and review multiple entries unnecessarily.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options above. Be sure to fill in all required arguments, such as text and coordinates (e.g., x and y), in the provided fields.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you want to tap an icon of an app, use the action \"Open_App\".  2. If you want to exit an app, use the action \"Home\".  3. When searching for information or performing a query in an app, use the \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\" shortcut if a text input box is present. This consolidates tapping, typing, and submitting into a single action, improving efficiency.  4. When performing a search in an app, ensure that the search query is specific enough to minimize irrelevant results. This can save time when reviewing the results.  5. If multiple steps are required to gather information (e.g., comparing details of two restaurants), plan the sequence of actions carefully to avoid unnecessary app switching or redundant searches.  6. When reviewing search results in an app, prioritize tapping on entries that are most likely to meet the task's criteria based on visible information (e.g., ratings, distance, or hours). This can reduce the need to open and review multiple entries unnecessarily.  7. When dismissing pop-ups or prompts (e.g., notifications), ensure that the action is necessary and does not disrupt the flow of the task. If such prompts are common, consider preemptively identifying their dismissal buttons to streamline the process.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options above. Be sure to fill in all required arguments, such as text and coordinates (e.g., x and y), in the provided fields.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you want to tap an icon of an app, use the action \"Open_App\".  2. If you want to exit an app, use the action \"Home\".  3. When searching for information or performing a query in an app, use the \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\" shortcut if a text input box is present. This consolidates tapping, typing, and submitting into a single action, improving efficiency.  4. When performing a search in an app, ensure that the search query is specific enough to minimize irrelevant results. This can save time when reviewing the results.  5. If multiple steps are required to gather information (e.g., comparing details of two restaurants), plan the sequence of actions carefully to avoid unnecessary app switching or redundant searches.  6. When reviewing search results in an app, prioritize tapping on entries that are most likely to meet the task's criteria based on visible information (e.g., ratings, distance, or hours). This can reduce the need to open and review multiple entries unnecessarily.  7. When dismissing pop-ups or prompts (e.g., notifications), ensure that the action is necessary and does not disrupt the flow of the task. If such prompts are common, consider preemptively identifying their dismissal buttons to streamline the process.  8. If a pop-up or prompt frequently appears during a task and is followed by a scrolling action, consider using a combined shortcut to dismiss the prompt and scroll in one sequence. This can save time and improve task flow.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options above. Be sure to fill in all required arguments, such as text and coordinates (e.g., x and y), in the provided fields.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you want to tap an icon of an app, use the action \"Open_App\".  2. If you want to exit an app, use the action \"Home\".  3. When searching for information or performing a query in an app, use the \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\" shortcut if a text input box is present. This consolidates tapping, typing, and submitting into a single action, improving efficiency.  4. When performing a search in an app, ensure that the search query is specific enough to minimize irrelevant results. This can save time when reviewing the results.  5. If multiple steps are required to gather information (e.g., comparing details of two restaurants), plan the sequence of actions carefully to avoid unnecessary app switching or redundant searches.  6. When reviewing search results in an app, prioritize tapping on entries that are most likely to meet the task's criteria based on visible information (e.g., ratings, distance, or hours). This can reduce the need to open and review multiple entries unnecessarily.  7. When dismissing pop-ups or prompts (e.g., notifications), ensure that the action is necessary and does not disrupt the flow of the task. If such prompts are common, consider preemptively identifying their dismissal buttons to streamline the process.  8. If a pop-up or prompt frequently appears during a task and is followed by a scrolling action, consider using a combined shortcut to dismiss the prompt and scroll in one sequence. This can save time and improve task flow.  9. When swiping to reveal more content, ensure that the swipe distance is sufficient to uncover the necessary information without requiring repeated swipes. This can improve efficiency and reduce redundant actions.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options above. Be sure to fill in all required arguments, such as text and coordinates (e.g., x and y), in the provided fields.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you want to tap an icon of an app, use the action \"Open_App\".  2. If you want to exit an app, use the action \"Home\".  3. When searching for information or performing a query in an app, use the \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\" shortcut if a text input box is present. This consolidates tapping, typing, and submitting into a single action, improving efficiency.  4. When performing a search in an app, ensure that the search query is specific enough to minimize irrelevant results. This can save time when reviewing the results.  5. If multiple steps are required to gather information (e.g., comparing details of two restaurants), plan the sequence of actions carefully to avoid unnecessary app switching or redundant searches.  6. When reviewing search results in an app, prioritize tapping on entries that are most likely to meet the task's criteria based on visible information (e.g., ratings, distance, or hours). This can reduce the need to open and review multiple entries unnecessarily.  7. When dismissing pop-ups or prompts (e.g., notifications), ensure that the action is necessary and does not disrupt the flow of the task. If such prompts are common, consider preemptively identifying their dismissal buttons to streamline the process.  8. If a pop-up or prompt frequently appears during a task and is followed by a scrolling action, consider using a combined shortcut to dismiss the prompt and scroll in one sequence. This can save time and improve task flow.  9. When swiping to reveal more content, ensure that the swipe distance is sufficient to uncover the necessary information without requiring repeated swipes. This can improve efficiency and reduce redundant actions.  10. When comparing multiple entries (e.g., restaurants, products), take note of key differentiators (e.g., ratings, hours, or reviews) visible in the search results to minimize the need for opening and reviewing each entry in detail.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options above. Be sure to fill in all required arguments, such as text and coordinates (e.g., x and y), in the provided fields.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n1. If you want to tap an icon of an app, use the action \"Open_App\".  2. If you want to exit an app, use the action \"Home\".  3. When searching for information or performing a query in an app, use the \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\" shortcut if a text input box is present. This consolidates tapping, typing, and submitting into a single action, improving efficiency.  4. When performing a search in an app, ensure that the search query is specific enough to minimize irrelevant results. This can save time when reviewing the results.  5. If multiple steps are required to gather information (e.g., comparing details of two restaurants), plan the sequence of actions carefully to avoid unnecessary app switching or redundant searches.  6. When reviewing search results in an app, prioritize tapping on entries that are most likely to meet the task's criteria based on visible information (e.g., ratings, distance, or hours). This can reduce the need to open and review multiple entries unnecessarily.  7. When dismissing pop-ups or prompts (e.g., notifications), ensure that the action is necessary and does not disrupt the flow of the task. If such prompts are common, consider preemptively identifying their dismissal buttons to streamline the process.  8. If a pop-up or prompt frequently appears during a task and is followed by a scrolling action, consider using a combined shortcut to dismiss the prompt and scroll in one sequence. This can save time and improve task flow.  9. When swiping to reveal more content, ensure that the swipe distance is sufficient to uncover the necessary information without requiring repeated swipes. This can improve efficiency and reduce redundant actions.  10. When comparing multiple entries (e.g., restaurants, products), take note of key differentiators (e.g., ratings, hours, or reviews) visible in the search results to minimize the need for opening and reviewing each entry in detail.  11. Before performing a swipe action to reveal more content, confirm that the current screen is displaying the correct context or entry. If the screen is showing a different entry or context, take corrective actions (e.g., navigating back or reselecting the desired entry) before proceeding with the swipe. This can prevent wasted actions and errors.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options above. Be sure to fill in all required arguments, such as text and coordinates (e.g., x and y), in the provided fields.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you want to tap an icon of an app, use the action \"Open_App\".  2. If you want to exit an app, use the action \"Home\".  3. When searching for information or performing a query in an app, use the \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\" shortcut if a text input box is present. This consolidates tapping, typing, and submitting into a single action, improving efficiency.  4. When performing a search in an app, ensure that the search query is specific enough to minimize irrelevant results. This can save time when reviewing the results.  5. If multiple steps are required to gather information (e.g., comparing details of two restaurants), plan the sequence of actions carefully to avoid unnecessary app switching or redundant searches.  6. When reviewing search results in an app, prioritize tapping on entries that are most likely to meet the task's criteria based on visible information (e.g., ratings, distance, or hours). This can reduce the need to open and review multiple entries unnecessarily.  7. When dismissing pop-ups or prompts (e.g., notifications), ensure that the action is necessary and does not disrupt the flow of the task. If such prompts are common, consider preemptively identifying their dismissal buttons to streamline the process.  8. If a pop-up or prompt frequently appears during a task and is followed by a scrolling action, consider using a combined shortcut to dismiss the prompt and scroll in one sequence. This can save time and improve task flow.  9. When swiping to reveal more content, ensure that the swipe distance is sufficient to uncover the necessary information without requiring repeated swipes. This can improve efficiency and reduce redundant actions.  10. When comparing multiple entries (e.g., restaurants, products), take note of key differentiators (e.g., ratings, hours, or reviews) visible in the search results to minimize the need for opening and reviewing each entry in detail.  11. Before performing a swipe action to reveal more content, confirm that the current screen is displaying the correct context or entry. If the screen is showing a different entry or context, take corrective actions (e.g., navigating back or reselecting the desired entry) before proceeding with the swipe. This can prevent wasted actions and errors.  12. If a swipe action fails to reveal new content, verify whether the screen is displaying the correct context or entry. If not, navigate back or reselect the desired entry before retrying the swipe. This can prevent repeated errors and wasted actions.  13. When dismissing a pop-up or prompt and scrolling immediately afterward, consider using a combined shortcut (e.g., \"Dismiss_And_Scroll\") to streamline the process and save time.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options above. Be sure to fill in all required arguments, such as text and coordinates (e.g., x and y), in the provided fields.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you want to tap an icon of an app, use the action \"Open_App\".  2. If you want to exit an app, use the action \"Home\".  3. When searching for information or performing a query in an app, use the \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\" shortcut if a text input box is present. This consolidates tapping, typing, and submitting into a single action, improving efficiency.  4. When performing a search in an app, ensure that the search query is specific enough to minimize irrelevant results. This can save time when reviewing the results.  5. If multiple steps are required to gather information (e.g., comparing details of two restaurants), plan the sequence of actions carefully to avoid unnecessary app switching or redundant searches.  6. When reviewing search results in an app, prioritize tapping on entries that are most likely to meet the task's criteria based on visible information (e.g., ratings, distance, or hours). This can reduce the need to open and review multiple entries unnecessarily.  7. When dismissing pop-ups or prompts (e.g., notifications), ensure that the action is necessary and does not disrupt the flow of the task. If such prompts are common, consider preemptively identifying their dismissal buttons to streamline the process.  8. If a pop-up or prompt frequently appears during a task and is followed by a scrolling action, consider using a combined shortcut to dismiss the prompt and scroll in one sequence. This can save time and improve task flow.  9. When swiping to reveal more content, ensure that the swipe distance is sufficient to uncover the necessary information without requiring repeated swipes. This can improve efficiency and reduce redundant actions.  10. When comparing multiple entries (e.g., restaurants, products), take note of key differentiators (e.g., ratings, hours, or reviews) visible in the search results to minimize the need for opening and reviewing each entry in detail.  11. Before performing a swipe action to reveal more content, confirm that the current screen is displaying the correct context or entry. If the screen is showing a different entry or context, take corrective actions (e.g., navigating back or reselecting the desired entry) before proceeding with the swipe. This can prevent wasted actions and errors.  12. If a swipe action fails to reveal new content, verify whether the screen is displaying the correct context or entry. If not, navigate back or reselect the desired entry before retrying the swipe. This can prevent repeated errors and wasted actions.  13. When dismissing a pop-up or prompt and scrolling immediately afterward, consider using a combined shortcut (e.g., \"Dismiss_And_Scroll\") to streamline the process and save time.  14. If a tap action results in opening the wrong entry or unintended content, use the \"Navigate_Back_And_Tap\" shortcut to quickly return to the previous screen and reselect the correct entry. This can save time and prevent repeated errors.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options above. Be sure to fill in all required arguments, such as text and coordinates (e.g., x and y), in the provided fields.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you want to tap an icon of an app, use the action \"Open_App\".  2. If you want to exit an app, use the action \"Home\".  3. When searching for information or performing a query in an app, use the \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\" shortcut if a text input box is present. This consolidates tapping, typing, and submitting into a single action, improving efficiency.  4. When performing a search in an app, ensure that the search query is specific enough to minimize irrelevant results. This can save time when reviewing the results.  5. If multiple steps are required to gather information (e.g., comparing details of two restaurants), plan the sequence of actions carefully to avoid unnecessary app switching or redundant searches.  6. When reviewing search results in an app, prioritize tapping on entries that are most likely to meet the task's criteria based on visible information (e.g., ratings, distance, or hours). This can reduce the need to open and review multiple entries unnecessarily.  7. When dismissing pop-ups or prompts (e.g., notifications), ensure that the action is necessary and does not disrupt the flow of the task. If such prompts are common, consider preemptively identifying their dismissal buttons to streamline the process.  8. If a pop-up or prompt frequently appears during a task and is followed by a scrolling action, consider using a combined shortcut to dismiss the prompt and scroll in one sequence. This can save time and improve task flow.  9. When swiping to reveal more content, ensure that the swipe distance is sufficient to uncover the necessary information without requiring repeated swipes. This can improve efficiency and reduce redundant actions.  10. When comparing multiple entries (e.g., restaurants, products), take note of key differentiators (e.g., ratings, hours, or reviews) visible in the search results to minimize the need for opening and reviewing each entry in detail.  11. Before performing a swipe action to reveal more content, confirm that the current screen is displaying the correct context or entry. If the screen is showing a different entry or context, take corrective actions (e.g., navigating back or reselecting the desired entry) before proceeding with the swipe. This can prevent wasted actions and errors.  12. If a swipe action fails to reveal new content, verify whether the screen is displaying the correct context or entry. If not, navigate back or reselect the desired entry before retrying the swipe. This can prevent repeated errors and wasted actions.  13. When dismissing a pop-up or prompt and scrolling immediately afterward, consider using a combined shortcut (e.g., \"Dismiss_And_Scroll\") to streamline the process and save time.  14. If a tap action results in opening the wrong entry or unintended content, use the \"Navigate_Back_And_Reselect\" shortcut to quickly return to the previous screen and reselect the correct entry. This can save time and prevent repeated errors.  15. When tapping on an entry in a list, ensure that the tap position is precise and aligned with the desired entry. Misaligned taps can lead to unintended content being opened, requiring corrective actions.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options above. Be sure to fill in all required arguments, such as text and coordinates (e.g., x and y), in the provided fields.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",
