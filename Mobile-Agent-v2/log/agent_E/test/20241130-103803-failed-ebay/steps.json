If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Finish(): Finish the task.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Finish(): Finish the task.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\nIf you want to type new text in a search box that already contains text you previously entered, make sure to clear it first by tapping the 'X' button.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Finish(): Finish the task.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",
