When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### History operations ###\nBefore reaching this page, some operations have been completed. You need to refer to the completed operations to decide the next operation. These operations are as follow:\nStep-1: [Operation: Opening the Booking.com app; Action: Open_App (Booking.com)]\nStep-2: [Operation: Tap on the \"Around current location\" field; Action: Tap (397, 548)]\nStep-3: [Operation: Type \"Champaign, IL\" into the search field; Action: Type (\"Champaign, IL\")]\nStep-4: [Operation: Tap on the \"Champaign\" option; Action: Tap (121, 347)]\nStep-5: [Operation: Tap on the \"Select dates\" button; Action: Tap (538, 2093)]\nStep-6: [Operation: Tap on the \"Search\" button; Action: Tap (538, 1015)]\nStep-7: [Operation: Tap on the \"Filter\" button; Action: Tap (569, 380)]\nStep-8: [Operation: Tap on \"Show matching filters\"; Action: Tap (538, 894)]\n\n### Progress ###\nAfter completing the history operations, you have the following thoughts about the progress of user's instruction completion:\nCompleted contents:\nOpened the Booking.com app, searched for \"Champaign, IL\", selected \"Champaign\" from the search results, accessed the search results page, and opened the filter options.\n\n### Memory ###\nDuring the operations, you record the following contents on the screenshot for use in subsequent operations:\nMemory:\nAround current location  \nChampaign\n\"Dec 14 - Dec 15 (1 night)\"\nRodeway Inn Urbana Champaign University Area  \nRating: 7.1 (Good \u00b7 300 reviews)  \nPrice: $73  \nDistance: 1.9 miles from downtown\n27 matching properties  \n+ 9 properties around Champaign\n\n### Last operation ###\nYou previously wanted to perform the operation \"Tap on the \"Your budget (for 1 night)\" section to adjust the budget filter.\" on this page and executed the Action \"Tap (232, 1284)\". But you find that this operation does not meet your expectation. You need to reflect and revise your operation this time.\n\n### Response requirements ###\nNow you need to combine all of the above to perform just one action on the current page. You must choose one of the six actions below:\nOpen_App (app name): If the current page is desktop, you can use this action to open the app named \"app name\" on the desktop.\nTap (x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current page.\nSwipe (x1, y1), (x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2).\nType (text): Type the \"text\".\nEnter: Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App: Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack: Return to the previous state.\nHome: Return to home page.\nWait: Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nStop: If you think all the requirements of user's instruction have been completed and no further operation is required, you can choose this action to terminate the operation process.\n\n### Output format ###\nYour output consists of the following three parts:\n### Thought ###\nThink step by step: check what has been completed and what still needs to be done. Before deciding to stop, put yourself in the user's shoes to ensure satisfaction with the current status. Make sure you have explored sufficiently if the situation implies further investigation.\n### Action ###\nYou can only choose one from the six actions above. Make sure that the coordinates or text in the \"()\".\n### Operation ###\nPlease generate a brief natural language description for the operation in Action based on your Thought.",
