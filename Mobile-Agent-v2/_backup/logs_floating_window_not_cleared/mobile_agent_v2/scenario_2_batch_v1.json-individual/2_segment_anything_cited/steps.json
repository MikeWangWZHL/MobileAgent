You need to refer to the completed operations to decide the next operation. These operations are as follow:\nStep-1: [Operation: Opening the Chrome app; Action: Open_App(Chrome)]\nStep-2: [Operation: Tap on the search bar; Action: Tap (111, 908)]\n\n### Progress ###\nAfter completing the history operations, you have the following thoughts about the progress of user's instruction completion:\nCompleted contents:\nOpened the Chrome app on the mobile phone and tapped on the search bar.\n\n### Last operation ###\nYou previously wanted to perform the operation \"Type the query \"most cited paper citing 'Segment Anything' -survey site:scholar.google.com\" into the search bar.\" on this page and executed the Action \"Type (\"most cited paper citing 'Segment Anything' -survey site:scholar.google.com\")\". But you find that this operation does not meet your expectation. You need to reflect and revise your operation this time.\n\n### Response requirements ###\nNow you need to combine all of the above to perform just one action on the current page. You must choose one of the six actions below:\nOpen_App (app name): If the current page is desktop, you can use this action to open the app named \"app name\" on the desktop.\nTap (x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current page.\nSwipe (x1, y1), (x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2).\nType (text): Type the \"text\".\nEnter: Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App: Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack: Return to the previous state.\nHome: Return to home page.\nWait: Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nStop: If you think all the requirements of user's instruction have been completed and no further operation is required, you can choose this action to terminate the operation process.\n\n### Output format ###\nYour output consists of the following three parts:\n### Thought ###\nThink step by step: check what has been completed and what still needs to be done. Before deciding to stop, put yourself in the user's shoes to ensure satisfaction with the current status. Make sure you have explored sufficiently if the situation implies further investigation.\n### Action ###\nYou can only choose one from the six actions above. Make sure that the coordinates or text in the \"()\".\n### Operation ###\nPlease generate a brief natural language description for the operation in Action based on your Thought.",

The main ingredients of the new\nframework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-\nbased global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite\nmatching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture.\nGiven a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons\nabout the relations of the objects and the global image context\nto directly output the final set of predictions in parallel.

The main ingredients of the new\nframework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-\nbased global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite\nmatching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture.\nGiven a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons\nabout the relations of the objects and the global image context\nto directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new\nmodel is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized\n[425, 2174]; text: library, unlike many other modern detectors.DETR\n[240, 2266]; text: III\n[68, 158]; icon: The icon is shaped like a house with a blue outline and white filling.\n[876, 157]; icon: The icon is square-shaped with rounded corners, filled with white color, and has black borderlines.\n[736, 157]; icon: The icon is a white plus sign with rounded edges, set against a black background.\n[77, 315]; icon: The icon is shaped like an arrow pointing to the left, with black lines outlining its path on a white background.\n[924, 42]; icon: The icon is a white Wi-Fi signal symbol with three bars below it, indicating the strength of the connection, set against a black background.\n[400, 156]; icon: The icon is circular with a white background, black border and blue text that says scholar.google.com/.\n[541, 2267]; icon: The icon is circular, white with a black outline, and depicts two overlapping rings.\n[170, 43]; icon: The icon is a white horizontal line with two black dots on either end, representing a minus symbol or subtraction sign.\n[961, 42]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, showing three horizontal lines indicating Wi-Fi signal strength, with two solid bars and one dotted bar, representing good connectivity.
