When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### History operations ###\nBefore reaching this page, some operations have been completed. You need to refer to the completed operations to decide the next operation. These operations are as follow:\nStep-1: [Operation: Tap on the \"Refresh your search\" button; Action: Tap (298, 1743)]\nStep-2: [Operation: Switch; Action: Switch_App]\nStep-3: [Operation: Switch back; Action: Switch_App]\nStep-4: [Operation: Switch back; Action: Switch_App]\nStep-5: [Operation: Tap the back button; Action: Tap (846, 2267)]\nStep-6: [Operation: Switch back; Action: Switch_App]\nStep-7: [Operation: Switch back; Action: Switch_App]\nStep-8: [Operation: Switch back; Action: Switch_App]\nStep-9: [Operation: Switch back; Action: Switch_App]\nStep-10: [Operation: Switch back; Action: Switch_App]\nStep-11: [Operation: Switch back; Action: Switch_App]\nStep-12: [Operation: Tap the back button; Action: Tap (846, 2267)]\n\n### Progress ###\nAfter completing the history operations, you have the following thoughts about the progress of user's instruction completion:\nCompleted contents:\nRefreshed the search results for hotels in the Booking app.\n\n### Last operation ###\nYou previously wanted to perform the operation \"Update the search query in the search bar to accurately reflect the user's request.\" on this page and executed the Action \"Type (\"hotels in Champaign IL under $200 queen bed rating above 7.0 near Green Street\").\".

You must choose one of the six actions below:\nOpen_App (app name): If the current page is desktop, you can use this action to open the app named \"app name\" on the desktop.\nTap (x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current page.\nSwipe (x1, y1), (x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2).\nType (text): Type the \"text\".\nEnter: Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App: Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack: Return to the previous state.\nHome: Return to home page.\nWait: Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nStop: If you think all the requirements of user's instruction have been completed and no further operation is required, you can choose this action to terminate the operation process.\n\n### Output format ###\nYour output consists of the following three parts:\n### Thought ###\nThink step by step: check what has been completed and what still needs to be done. Before deciding to stop, put yourself in the user's shoes to ensure satisfaction with the current status. Make sure you have explored sufficiently if the situation implies further investigation.\n### Action ###\nYou can only choose one from the six actions above.
