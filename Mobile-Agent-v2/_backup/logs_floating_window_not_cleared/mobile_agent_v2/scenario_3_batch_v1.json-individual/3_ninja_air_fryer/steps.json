Before deciding to stop, put yourself in the user's shoes to ensure satisfaction with the current status. Make sure you have explored sufficiently if the situation implies further investigation.\n### Action ###\nYou can only choose one from the six actions above.

These operations are as follow:\nStep-1: [Operation: Opening the Amazon Shopping app; Action: Open_App(Amazon Shopping)]\nStep-2: [Operation: Tap on the search bar; Action: Tap (602, 168)]\nStep-3: [Operation: Tap on the search bar; Action: Tap (602, 168)]\nStep-4: [Operation: Tap the \"X\" icon; Action: Tap (1017, 841)]\nStep-5: [Operation: Tap on the search bar; Action: Tap (602, 168)]\nStep-6: [Operation: Tap the \"X\" icon; Action: Tap (1017, 841)]\nStep-7: [Operation: Tap on the search bar; Action: Tap (602, 168)]\nStep-8: [Operation: Tap the \"X\" icon; Action: Tap (1017, 841)]\nStep-9: [Operation: Tap the \"X\" icon; Action: Tap (1017, 841)]\nStep-10: [Operation: Tap on the search bar; Action: Tap (602, 168)]\nStep-11: [Operation: Tap the \"X\" icon; Action: Tap (1017, 841)]\nStep-12: [Operation: Switch back; Action: Switch_App]\nStep-13: [Operation: Switch back; Action: Switch_App]\nStep-14: [Operation: Switch; Action: Switch_App]\nStep-15: [Operation: Switch; Action: Switch_App]\nStep-16: [Operation: Tap on the search bar in the Amazon app; Action: Tap (602, 168)]\nStep-17: [Operation: Tap the \"X\" icon; Action: Tap (1017, 841)]\nStep-18: [Operation: Tap the \"X\" icon; Action: Tap (1017, 841)]\nStep-19: [Operation: Tap the \"X\" icon; Action: Tap (1017, 841)]\nStep-20: [Operation: Tap the \"X\" icon; Action: Tap (1017, 841)]\nStep-21: [Operation: Tap the \"X\" icon; Action: Tap (1017, 841)]\nStep-22: [Operation: Tap the \"X\" icon; Action: Tap (1017, 841)]\n\n### Progress ###\nAfter completing the history operations, you have the following thoughts about the progress of user's instruction completion:\nCompleted contents:\nOpened the Amazon Shopping app and accessed the search bar, clearing any previous search text multiple times. Attempted to switch apps multiple times.\n\n### Last operation ###\nYou previously wanted to perform the operation \"Tap the \"X\" icon to clear the current text in the search bar.\" on this page and executed the Action \"Tap (1017, 841)\". But you find that this operation does not meet your expectation. You need to reflect and revise your operation this time.\n\n### Response requirements ###\nNow you need to combine all of the above to perform just one action on the current page. You must choose one of the six actions below:\nOpen_App (app name): If the current page is desktop, you can use this action to open the app named \"app name\" on the desktop.\nTap (x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current page.\nSwipe (x1, y1), (x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2).\nType (text): Type the \"text\".\nEnter: Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App: Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack: Return to the previous state.\nHome: Return to home page.\nWait: Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nStop: If you think all the requirements of user's instruction have been completed and no further operation is required, you can choose this action to terminate the operation process.\n\n### Output format ###\nYour output consists of the following three parts:\n### Thought ###\nThink step by step: check what has been completed and what still needs to be done. Before deciding to stop, put yourself in the user's shoes to ensure satisfaction with the current status. Make sure you have explored sufficiently if the situation implies further investigation.\n### Action ###\nYou can only choose one from the six actions above. Make sure that the coordinates or text in the \"()\".\n### Operation ###\nPlease generate a brief natural language description for the operation in Action based on your Thought.",

Attempted to switch apps multiple times.\n\n### Last operation ###\nYou previously wanted to perform the operation \"Type \"Ninja air fryer 8 qt\" into the search bar to search for the product on Amazon.\" on this page and executed the Action \"Type (\"Ninja air fryer 8 qt\")\". But you find that this operation does not meet your expectation. You need to reflect and revise your operation this time.\n\n### Response requirements ###\nNow you need to combine all of the above to perform just one action on the current page. You must choose one of the six actions below:\nOpen_App (app name): If the current page is desktop, you can use this action to open the app named \"app name\" on the desktop.\nTap (x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current page.\nSwipe (x1, y1), (x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2).\nType (text): Type the \"text\".\nEnter: Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App: Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack: Return to the previous state.\nHome: Return to home page.\nWait: Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nStop: If you think all the requirements of user's instruction have been completed and no further operation is required, you can choose this action to terminate the operation process.\n\n### Output format ###\nYour output consists of the following three parts:\n### Thought ###\nThink step by step: check what has been completed and what still needs to be done. Before deciding to stop, put yourself in the user's shoes to ensure satisfaction with the current status. Make sure you have explored sufficiently if the situation implies further investigation.\n### Action ###\nYou can only choose one from the six actions above. Make sure that the coordinates or text in the \"()\".\n### Operation ###\nPlease generate a brief natural language description for the operation in Action based on your Thought.",

Before deciding to stop, put yourself in the user's shoes to ensure satisfaction with the current status. Make sure you have explored sufficiently if the situation implies further investigation.\n### Action ###\nYou can only choose one from the six actions above.
