The hints are as follow:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### History operations ###\nBefore reaching this page, some operations have been completed. You need to refer to the completed operations to decide the next operation. These operations are as follow:\nStep-1: [Operation: Opening the Walmart app; Action: Open_App(Walmart)]\nStep-2: [Operation: Tap on the search bar; Action: Tap (233, 326)]\nStep-3: [Operation: Type \"ribeye steak\" into the search bar; Action: Type (\"ribeye steak\")]\n\n### Progress ###\nAfter completing the history operations, you have the following thoughts about the progress of user's instruction completion:\nCompleted contents:\nOpened the Walmart app, tapped on the search bar, and typed \"ribeye steak\" into the search bar.\n\n### Last operation ###\nYou previously wanted to perform the operation \"Tap on the \"ribeye steak\" option to view its details and check if it is on sale.\" on this page and executed the Action \"Tap (286, 161)\". But you find that this operation does not meet your expectation. You need to reflect and revise your operation this time.\n\n### Response requirements ###\nNow you need to combine all of the above to perform just one action on the current page.

Before deciding to stop, put yourself in the user's shoes to ensure satisfaction with the current status. Make sure you have explored sufficiently if the situation implies further investigation.\n### Action ###\nYou can only choose one from the six actions above.

You need to combine the screenshot to understand.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nWe extract the keyboard status of the current screenshot and it is whether the keyboard of the current screenshot is activated.\nThe keyboard status is as follow:\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Hint ###\nThere are hints to help you complete the user's instructions. The hints are as follow:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### History operations ###\nBefore reaching this page, some operations have been completed. You need to refer to the completed operations to decide the next operation. These operations are as follow:\nStep-1: [Operation: Opening the Walmart app; Action: Open_App(Walmart)]\nStep-2: [Operation: Tap on the search bar; Action: Tap (233, 326)]\nStep-3: [Operation: Type \"ribeye steak\" into the search bar; Action: Type (\"ribeye steak\")]\nStep-4: [Operation: Press the \"Enter\" key; Action: Enter]\nStep-5: [Operation: Scroll down the page; Action: Swipe (500, 1500), (500, 500)]\nStep-6: [Operation: Tap on the search bar in the Walmart app; Action: Tap (233, 326)]\nStep-7: [Operation: Tap on the search bar; Action: Tap (233, 326)]\nStep-8: [Operation: Tap on the search bar; Action: Tap (233, 326)]\nStep-9: [Operation: Tap on the search bar; Action: Tap (233, 326)]\nStep-10: [Operation: Type \"toilet paper\" into the search bar; Action: Type (\"toilet paper\")]\nStep-11: [Operation: Tap on the \"toilet paper\" option in the search results; Action: Tap (246, 557)]\n\n### Progress ###\nAfter completing the history operations, you have the following thoughts about the progress of user's instruction completion:\nCompleted contents:\nOpened the Walmart app, tapped on the search bar, typed \"ribeye steak\" into the search bar, initiated a search for \"ribeye steak\", scrolled down the search results page, tapped on the search bar multiple times, typed \"toilet paper\" into the search bar, tapped on the \"toilet paper\" option in the search results.\n\n### Memory ###\nDuring the operations, you record the following contents on the screenshot for use in subsequent operations:\nMemory:\nRibeye steak: $25.07 (avg price $15.97/lb)\nToilet paper: $7.97\n\n### Last operation ###\nYou previously wanted to perform the operation \"Opening the Notes app to record the price of toilet paper ($7.97).\" on this page and executed the Action \"Open_App(Notes)\". But you find that this operation does not meet your expectation. You need to reflect and revise your operation this time.\n\n### Response requirements ###\nNow you need to combine all of the above to perform just one action on the current page.

Before deciding to stop, put yourself in the user's shoes to ensure satisfaction with the current status. Make sure you have explored sufficiently if the situation implies further investigation.\n### Action ###\nYou can only choose one from the six actions above.
