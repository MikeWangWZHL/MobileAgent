By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### History operations ###\nBefore reaching this page, some operations have been completed. You need to refer to the completed operations to decide the next operation.

Before deciding to stop, put yourself in the user's shoes to ensure satisfaction with the current status. Make sure you have explored sufficiently if the situation implies further investigation.\n### Action ###\nYou can only choose one from the six actions above.

Then returned to the home screen multiple times.\n\n### Memory ###\nDuring the operations, you record the following contents on the screenshot for use in subsequent operations:\nMemory:\nWICKED (2024)  \nRating: PG, 2 hr 40 min  \nRotten Tomatoes: 88%  \nAudience Score: 95%  \nShowtime: 3:30p at AMC CLASSIC Mattoon 10\n\n### Last operation ###\nYou previously wanted to perform the operation \"Opening the Notes app to create a note for the highest-rated movie.\" on this page and executed the Action \"Open_App(Notes)\".

Before deciding to stop, put yourself in the user's shoes to ensure satisfaction with the current status. Make sure you have explored sufficiently if the situation implies further investigation.\n### Action ###\nYou can only choose one from the six actions above. Make sure that the coordinates or text in the \"()\".\n### Operation ###\nPlease generate a brief natural language description for the operation in Action based on your Thought.",
