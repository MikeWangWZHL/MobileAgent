You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **BakeLab**   - Rating: 4.8 (260 reviews)   - Distance: 0.8 miles   - Price Range: $1\u2013$10   - Open Now (Closes at 6 PM)   - Offers French-style pastries such as croissants and cakes.   - Phone Number: [Call button visible, phone number needs to be retrieved].  Next step: Retrieve the phone number by tapping the \"Call\" button and create a note in the Notes app.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **BakeLab**   - Rating: 4.8 (260 reviews)   - Distance: 0.8 miles   - Price Range: $1\u2013$10   - Open Now (Closes at 6 PM)   - Offers French-style pastries such as croissants and cakes.   - Phone Number: +1 217-666-0355\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Consider the following:\n(1) Are there any sequences of actions that occurred repeatedly and can be consolidated into new \"shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions.\n(2) Are there any general tips that might be useful for handling future tasks, such as advice on preventing certain common errors?\n\nProvide your output in the following format containing two parts:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar atomic action sequences are not included.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n### Updated Tips ###\nIf you have any important new tips to add (not already included in the existing tips), combine them with the current list. If there are no new tips, simply copy the existing tips here. Keep your tips concise and general. IMPORTANT: DO NOT create shortcut names that do not exist.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. 1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error. 3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. When searching for a specific business or location, ensure the search term is precise to avoid irrelevant results.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **BakeLab**   - Rating: 4.8 (260 reviews)   - Distance: 0.8 miles   - Price Range: $1\u2013$10   - Open Now (Closes at 6 PM)   - Offers French-style pastries such as croissants and cakes.   - Phone Number: +1 217-666-0355\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen.

Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. 1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error. 3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. When searching for a specific business or location, ensure the search term is precise to avoid irrelevant results.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **BakeLab**   - Rating: 4.8 (260 reviews)   - Distance: 0.8 miles   - Price Range: $1\u2013$10   - Open Now (Closes at 6 PM)   - Offers French-style pastries such as croissants and cakes.   - Phone Number: +1 217-666-0355\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. 1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error. 3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. When searching for a specific business or location, ensure the search term is precise to avoid irrelevant results.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **BakeLab**   - Rating: 4.8 (260 reviews)   - Distance: 0.8 miles   - Price Range: $1\u2013$10   - Open Now (Closes at 6 PM)   - Offers French-style pastries such as croissants and cakes.   - Phone Number: +1 217-666-0355\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y).

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Consider the following:\n(1) Are there any sequences of actions that occurred repeatedly and can be consolidated into new \"shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions.\n(2) Are there any general tips that might be useful for handling future tasks, such as advice on preventing certain common errors?\n\nProvide your output in the following format containing two parts:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar atomic action sequences are not included.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n### Updated Tips ###\nIf you have any important new tips to add (not already included in the existing tips), combine them with the current list. If there are no new tips, simply copy the existing tips here. Keep your tips concise and general. IMPORTANT: DO NOT create shortcut names that do not exist. Add new tips only if they are essential for future interactions.\n",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen.

Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for a specific business or location, ensure the search term is precise to avoid irrelevant results.  5. If swiping fails to reveal additional content or apps, consider using visible buttons like \"Show more\" to access hidden elements.  6. Avoid repeated swipes in the same direction if they do not yield the expected result; instead, reassess the screen for alternative navigation options.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **BakeLab**   - Rating: 4.8 (260 reviews)   - Distance: 0.8 miles   - Price Range: $1\u2013$10   - Open Now (Closes at 6 PM)   - Offers French-style pastries such as croissants and cakes.   - Phone Number: +1 217-666-0355\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Find the phone number and create a new note in Notes for that.\n\n### Overall Plan ###\nThe current plan remains valid: 1. Open the Google Maps app. \u2705  2. Search for \"bakery near me.\" \u2705  3. Filter results to show bakeries within a 10-minute drive. \u2705  4. Check the details of bakeries to confirm they offer birthday cakes. \u2705  5. Note the phone number of a suitable bakery. \u2705  6. Open the Notes app and create a new note with the bakery's name and phone number. \u2705\n\n### Progress Status ###\nThe \"Create Note\" button has been successfully tapped, and a blank note is now open. The next step is to input the following details:  - **Name**: BakeLab  - **Phone Number**: +1 217-666-0355\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nInput the following details into the blank note:  - **Name**: BakeLab  - **Phone Number**: +1 217-666-0355\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nThe most recent actions you took and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will press the home button, closing the notification panel and returning to the home screen. From there, I can locate and open the Notes app to create a new note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 2000, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 1000}} | Description: This action will swipe upward on the screen to reveal the next page of apps, where the Notes app might be located. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not reveal a new page of apps. Instead, the screen now displays a search interface with suggestions and options like \"Downloads\" and \"Screenshots,\" which is unrelated to the task of locating the Notes app. This indicates that the swipe gesture may have been misinterpreted or executed in a way that triggered a different function.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 538, 'y': 733}} | Description: Tap the \"Show more\" button to reveal additional apps, which may include the Notes app. This will help locate the app to create a new note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 921, 'y': 896}} | Description: This action will tap on the Notes app icon to open it, allowing me to create a new note with the bakery's name and phone number. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 932, 'y': 2054}} | Description: Tap the \"Create Note\" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen to start creating a new note.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has been activated and you can type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for a specific business or location, ensure the search term is precise to avoid irrelevant results.  5. If swiping fails to reveal additional content or apps, consider using visible buttons like \"Show more\" to access hidden elements.  6. Avoid repeated swipes in the same direction if they do not yield the expected result; instead, reassess the screen for alternative navigation options.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **BakeLab**   - Rating: 4.8 (260 reviews)   - Distance: 0.8 miles   - Price Range: $1\u2013$10   - Open Now (Closes at 6 PM)   - Offers French-style pastries such as croissants and cakes.   - Phone Number: +1 217-666-0355\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for a specific business or location, ensure the search term is precise to avoid irrelevant results.  5. If swiping fails to reveal additional content or apps, consider using visible buttons like \"Show more\" to access hidden elements.  6. Avoid repeated swipes in the same direction if they do not yield the expected result; instead, reassess the screen for alternative navigation options.\n\n### Existing Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n### Atomic Actions ###\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2).

Find the phone number and create a new note in Notes for that.\n\n### Overall Plan ###\nThe current plan is complete: 1. Open the Google Maps app. \u2705  2. Search for \"bakery near me.\" \u2705  3. Filter results to show bakeries within a 10-minute drive. \u2705  4. Check the details of bakeries to confirm they offer birthday cakes. \u2705  5. Note the phone number of a suitable bakery. \u2705  6. Open the Notes app and create a new note with the bakery's name and phone number. \u2705\n\n### Progress Status ###\nThe details have been successfully input into the blank note. The progress status is now updated as follows: - **Name**: BakeLab  - **Phone Number**: +1 217-666-0355  - The note has been created successfully. Task completed.\n\n### Full Action History ###\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: This action will open the Google Maps app, allowing me to search for bakeries nearby. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 304, 'y': 173, 'text': 'bakery near me'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"bakery near me,\" and press Enter to initiate the search for nearby bakeries. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 838, 'y': 1900}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Call\" button for BakeLab, which is expected to reveal the bakery's phone number. This is the next step in retrieving the required information to create a note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to create a new note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 2340}} | Description: This action will swipe up to reveal the next page of apps, where the Notes app might be located. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not result in any visible change to the screen. The app icons and layout remain identical before and after the action, indicating that the swipe did not reveal a new page of apps.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 2340}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to reveal the next page of apps, where the Notes app might be located. This action is expected to display additional apps that are not currently visible. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action intended to reveal the next page of apps did not produce the expected result. Instead, the screen now displays the notification panel, which suggests that the swipe gesture was misinterpreted as a downward swipe to open notifications rather than an upward swipe to navigate to the next page of apps.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will press the home button, closing the notification panel and returning to the home screen. From there, I can locate and open the Notes app to create a new note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 2000, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 1000}} | Description: This action will swipe upward on the screen to reveal the next page of apps, where the Notes app might be located. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not reveal a new page of apps. Instead, the screen now displays a search interface with suggestions and options like \"Downloads\" and \"Screenshots,\" which is unrelated to the task of locating the Notes app. This indicates that the swipe gesture may have been misinterpreted or executed in a way that triggered a different function.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 538, 'y': 733}} | Description: Tap the \"Show more\" button to reveal additional apps, which may include the Notes app. This will help locate the app to create a new note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 921, 'y': 896}} | Description: This action will tap on the Notes app icon to open it, allowing me to create a new note with the bakery's name and phone number. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 932, 'y': 2054}} | Description: Tap the \"Create Note\" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen to start creating a new note.

Consider the following:\n(1) Are there any sequences of actions that occurred repeatedly and can be consolidated into new \"shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions.\n(2) Are there any general tips that might be useful for handling future tasks, such as advice on preventing certain common errors?\n\nProvide your output in the following format containing two parts:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar atomic action sequences are not included.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n### Updated Tips ###\nIf you have any important new tips to add (not already included in the existing tips), combine them with the current list. If there are no new tips, simply copy the existing tips here. Keep your tips concise and general. IMPORTANT: DO NOT create shortcut names that do not exist. Add new tips only if they are essential for future interactions.\n",
