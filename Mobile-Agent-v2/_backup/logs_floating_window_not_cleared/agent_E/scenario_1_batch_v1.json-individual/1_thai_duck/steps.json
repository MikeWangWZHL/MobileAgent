You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL\" has been completed. - A restaurant named **Siam Terrace** is displayed with the following details:  - Rating: 4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)  - Price range: $10\u201320  - Cuisine: Thai  - Status: Closed (Opens at 11 AM)  - Distance: 1.3 miles  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Consider the following:\n(1) Are there any sequences of actions that occurred repeatedly and can be consolidated into new \"shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions.\n(2) Are there any general tips that might be useful for handling future tasks, such as advice on preventing certain common errors?\n\nProvide your output in the following format containing two parts:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar atomic action sequences are not included.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n### Updated Tips ###\nIf you have any important new tips to add (not already included in the existing tips), combine them with the current list. If there are no new tips, simply copy the existing tips here. Keep your tips concise and general. IMPORTANT: DO NOT create shortcut names that do not exist. Add new tips only if they are essential for future interactions.\n",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. 1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error. 3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. When accessing menus or dropdowns, ensure that the desired option is visible or accessible after tapping the menu button to avoid unnecessary retries.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL\" has been completed.  - A restaurant named **Siam Terrace** is displayed with the following details:   - Rating: 4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)   - Price range: $10\u201320   - Cuisine: Thai   - Status: Closed (Opens at 11 AM)   - Distance: 1.3 miles   - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - The menu or ordering options for Siam Terrace have been accessed.  - Ordering platforms available for Siam Terrace include:   - **Menufy**: Service fee $1.75, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Storefront by DoorDash**: No fee, ready in 14\u201320 minutes.   - **EatStreet**: No fee, ready in 7 minutes.   - **Grubhub**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Seamless**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Caviar**: No fee.  - Siam Terrace contact details:   - Phone: (217) 367-8424   - Address: 212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801  - Opening hours: 11:00 AM - 10:00 PM.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. 1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error. 3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. When accessing menus or dropdowns, ensure that the desired option is visible or accessible after tapping the menu button to avoid unnecessary retries.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL\" has been completed.  - A restaurant named **Siam Terrace** is displayed with the following details:   - Rating: 4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)   - Price range: $10\u201320   - Cuisine: Thai   - Status: Closed (Opens at 11 AM)   - Distance: 1.3 miles   - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - The menu or ordering options for Siam Terrace have been accessed.  - Ordering platforms available for Siam Terrace include:   - **Menufy**: Service fee $1.75, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Storefront by DoorDash**: No fee, ready in 14\u201320 minutes.   - **EatStreet**: No fee, ready in 7 minutes.   - **Grubhub**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Seamless**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Caviar**: No fee.  - Siam Terrace contact details:   - Phone: (217) 367-8424   - Address: 212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801  - Opening hours: 11:00 AM - 10:00 PM.  - No confirmation yet on whether duck dishes are served. Proceed to check the menu or reviews for this information.  - Current screen shows options for **HOME**, **GALLERY**, and **CONTACT**. Further exploration is needed to locate the menu or reviews.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. 1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error. 3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. When accessing menus or dropdowns, ensure that the desired option is visible or accessible after tapping the menu button to avoid unnecessary retries.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL\" has been completed.  - A restaurant named **Siam Terrace** is displayed with the following details:   - Rating: 4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)   - Price range: $10\u201320   - Cuisine: Thai   - Status: Closed (Opens at 11 AM)   - Distance: 1.3 miles   - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - The menu or ordering options for Siam Terrace have been accessed.  - Ordering platforms available for Siam Terrace include:   - **Menufy**: Service fee $1.75, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Storefront by DoorDash**: No fee, ready in 14\u201320 minutes.   - **EatStreet**: No fee, ready in 7 minutes.   - **Grubhub**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Seamless**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Caviar**: No fee.  - Siam Terrace contact details:   - Phone: (217) 367-8424   - Address: 212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801  - Opening hours: 11:00 AM - 10:00 PM.  - No confirmation yet on whether duck dishes are served.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Consider the following:\n(1) Are there any sequences of actions that occurred repeatedly and can be consolidated into new \"shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions.\n(2) Are there any general tips that might be useful for handling future tasks, such as advice on preventing certain common errors?\n\nProvide your output in the following format containing two parts:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar atomic action sequences are not included.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n### Updated Tips ###\nIf you have any important new tips to add (not already included in the existing tips), combine them with the current list. If there are no new tips, simply copy the existing tips here. Keep your tips concise and general. IMPORTANT: DO NOT create shortcut names that do not exist. Add new tips only if they are essential for future interactions.\n",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When accessing menus or dropdowns, ensure that the desired option is visible or accessible after tapping the menu button to avoid unnecessary retries.  5. If an action does not yield the expected result (e.g., tapping a button does not navigate to the desired page), consider swiping or exploring alternative navigation options before retrying the same action.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL\" has been completed.  - A restaurant named **Siam Terrace** is displayed with the following details:   - Rating: 4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)   - Price range: $10\u201320   - Cuisine: Thai   - Status: Closed (Opens at 11 AM)   - Distance: 1.3 miles   - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - The menu or ordering options for Siam Terrace have been accessed.  - Ordering platforms available for Siam Terrace include:   - **Menufy**: Service fee $1.75, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Storefront by DoorDash**: No fee, ready in 14\u201320 minutes.   - **EatStreet**: No fee, ready in 7 minutes.   - **Grubhub**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Seamless**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Caviar**: No fee.  - Siam Terrace contact details:   - Phone: (217) 367-8424   - Address: 212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801  - Opening hours: 11:00 AM - 10:00 PM.  - Siam Terrace serves \"Mock Duck Curry\" as part of their menu.  - The **HOME** page displays a welcome message for Siam Terrace, mentioning that they serve Thai and Japanese cuisine, including dishes like Pad Thai, Cashew Nut Chicken, and Mock Duck Curry.  - Cuisines offered include Thai, Sushi, Asian, Chicken, Curry, Grill, Salads, Soup, Seafood, Dessert, Wraps, Pasta, Noodles, Fish, and Wings.  - The restaurant is located near Urbana Free Library on Main Street and offers online ordering for carryout or delivery.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When accessing menus or dropdowns, ensure that the desired option is visible or accessible after tapping the menu button to avoid unnecessary retries.  5. If an action does not yield the expected result (e.g., tapping a button does not navigate to the desired page), consider swiping or exploring alternative navigation options before retrying the same action.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL\" has been completed.  - A restaurant named **Siam Terrace** is displayed with the following details:   - Rating: 4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)   - Price range: $10\u201320   - Cuisine: Thai   - Status: Closed (Opens at 11 AM)   - Distance: 1.3 miles   - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - The menu or ordering options for Siam Terrace have been accessed.  - Ordering platforms available for Siam Terrace include:   - **Menufy**: Service fee $1.75, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Storefront by DoorDash**: No fee, ready in 14\u201320 minutes.   - **EatStreet**: No fee, ready in 7 minutes.   - **Grubhub**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Seamless**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Caviar**: No fee.  - Siam Terrace contact details:   - Phone: (217) 367-8424   - Address: 212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801  - Opening hours: 11:00 AM - 10:00 PM.  - Siam Terrace serves \"Mock Duck Curry\" as part of their menu.  - The **HOME** page displays a welcome message for Siam Terrace, mentioning that they serve Thai and Japanese cuisine, including dishes like Pad Thai, Cashew Nut Chicken, and Mock Duck Curry.  - Cuisines offered include Thai, Sushi, Asian, Chicken, Curry, Grill, Salads, Soup, Seafood, Dessert, Wraps, Pasta, Noodles, Fish, and Wings.  - The restaurant is located near Urbana Free Library on Main Street and offers online ordering for carryout or delivery.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When accessing menus or dropdowns, ensure that the desired option is visible or accessible after tapping the menu button to avoid unnecessary retries.  5. If an action does not yield the expected result (e.g., tapping a button does not navigate to the desired page), consider swiping or exploring alternative navigation options before retrying the same action.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL\" has been completed.  - A restaurant named **Siam Terrace** is displayed with the following details:   - Rating: 4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)   - Price range: $10\u201320   - Cuisine: Thai   - Status: Closed (Opens at 11 AM)   - Distance: 1.3 miles   - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - The menu or ordering options for Siam Terrace have been accessed.  - Ordering platforms available for Siam Terrace include:   - **Menufy**: Service fee $1.75, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Storefront by DoorDash**: No fee, ready in 14\u201320 minutes.   - **EatStreet**: No fee, ready in 7 minutes.   - **Grubhub**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Seamless**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Caviar**: No fee.  - Siam Terrace contact details:   - Phone: (217) 367-8424   - Address: 212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801  - Opening hours: 11:00 AM - 10:00 PM.  - Siam Terrace serves \"Mock Duck Curry\" as part of their menu.  - The **HOME** page displays a welcome message for Siam Terrace, mentioning that they serve Thai and Japanese cuisine, including dishes like Pad Thai, Cashew Nut Chicken, and Mock Duck Curry.  - Cuisines offered include Thai, Sushi, Asian, Chicken, Curry, Grill, Salads, Soup, Seafood, Dessert, Wraps, Pasta, Noodles, Fish, and Wings.  - The restaurant is located near Urbana Free Library on Main Street and offers online ordering for carryout or delivery.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Consider the following:\n(1) Are there any sequences of actions that occurred repeatedly and can be consolidated into new \"shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions.\n(2) Are there any general tips that might be useful for handling future tasks, such as advice on preventing certain common errors?\n\nProvide your output in the following format containing two parts:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar atomic action sequences are not included.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n### Updated Tips ###\nIf you have any important new tips to add (not already included in the existing tips), combine them with the current list. If there are no new tips, simply copy the existing tips here. Keep your tips concise and general. IMPORTANT: DO NOT create shortcut names that do not exist. Add new tips only if they are essential for future interactions.\n",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When accessing menus or dropdowns, ensure that the desired option is visible or accessible after tapping the menu button to avoid unnecessary retries.  5. If an action does not yield the expected result (e.g., tapping a button does not navigate to the desired page), consider swiping or exploring alternative navigation options before retrying the same action.  6. If swiping does not reveal the desired content, consider combining swiping with tapping on specific areas of the screen to navigate to hidden elements.  7. When retrying a failed action, ensure that the screen state has changed or refreshed to avoid repeating the same error.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL\" has been completed.  - A restaurant named **Siam Terrace** is displayed with the following details:   - Rating: 4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)   - Price range: $10\u201320   - Cuisine: Thai   - Status: Closed (Opens at 11 AM)   - Distance: 1.3 miles   - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - The menu or ordering options for Siam Terrace have been accessed.  - Ordering platforms available for Siam Terrace include:   - **Menufy**: Service fee $1.75, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Storefront by DoorDash**: No fee, ready in 14\u201320 minutes.   - **EatStreet**: No fee, ready in 7 minutes.   - **Grubhub**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Seamless**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Caviar**: No fee.  - Siam Terrace contact details:   - Phone: (217) 367-8424   - Address: 212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801  - Opening hours: 11:00 AM - 10:00 PM.  - Siam Terrace serves \"Mock Duck Curry\" as part of their menu.  - The **HOME** page displays a welcome message for Siam Terrace, mentioning that they serve Thai and Japanese cuisine, including dishes like Pad Thai, Cashew Nut Chicken, and Mock Duck Curry.  - Cuisines offered include Thai, Sushi, Asian, Chicken, Curry, Grill, Salads, Soup, Seafood, Dessert, Wraps, Pasta, Noodles, Fish, and Wings.  - The restaurant is located near Urbana Free Library on Main Street and offers online ordering for carryout or delivery.  - Proceed to review customer comments to compile a summary of positive and negative feedback.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When accessing menus or dropdowns, ensure that the desired option is visible or accessible after tapping the menu button to avoid unnecessary retries.  5. If an action does not yield the expected result (e.g., tapping a button does not navigate to the desired page), consider swiping or exploring alternative navigation options before retrying the same action.  6. If swiping does not reveal the desired content, consider combining swiping with tapping on specific areas of the screen to navigate to hidden elements.  7. When retrying a failed action, ensure that the screen state has changed or refreshed to avoid repeating the same error.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL\" has been completed.  - A restaurant named **Siam Terrace** is displayed with the following details:   - Rating: 4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)   - Price range: $10\u201320   - Cuisine: Thai   - Status: Closed (Opens at 11 AM)   - Distance: 1.3 miles   - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - The menu or ordering options for Siam Terrace have been accessed.  - Ordering platforms available for Siam Terrace include:   - **Menufy**: Service fee $1.75, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Storefront by DoorDash**: No fee, ready in 14\u201320 minutes.   - **EatStreet**: No fee, ready in 7 minutes.   - **Grubhub**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Seamless**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Caviar**: No fee.  - Siam Terrace contact details:   - Phone: (217) 367-8424   - Address: 212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801  - Opening hours: 11:00 AM - 10:00 PM.  - Siam Terrace serves \"Mock Duck Curry\" as part of their menu.  - The **HOME** page displays a welcome message for Siam Terrace, mentioning that they serve Thai and Japanese cuisine, including dishes like Pad Thai, Cashew Nut Chicken, and Mock Duck Curry.  - Cuisines offered include Thai, Sushi, Asian, Chicken, Curry, Grill, Salads, Soup, Seafood, Dessert, Wraps, Pasta, Noodles, Fish, and Wings.  - The restaurant is located near Urbana Free Library on Main Street and offers online ordering for carryout or delivery.  - Proceed to review customer comments to compile a summary of positive and negative feedback.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When accessing menus or dropdowns, ensure that the desired option is visible or accessible after tapping the menu button to avoid unnecessary retries.  5. If an action does not yield the expected result (e.g., tapping a button does not navigate to the desired page), consider swiping or exploring alternative navigation options before retrying the same action.  6. If swiping does not reveal the desired content, consider combining swiping with tapping on specific areas of the screen to navigate to hidden elements.  7. When retrying a failed action, ensure that the screen state has changed or refreshed to avoid repeating the same error.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL\" has been completed.  - A restaurant named **Siam Terrace** is displayed with the following details:   - Rating: 4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)   - Price range: $10\u201320   - Cuisine: Thai   - Status: Closed (Opens at 11 AM)   - Distance: 1.3 miles   - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - The menu or ordering options for Siam Terrace have been accessed.  - Ordering platforms available for Siam Terrace include:   - **Menufy**: Service fee $1.75, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Storefront by DoorDash**: No fee, ready in 14\u201320 minutes.   - **EatStreet**: No fee, ready in 7 minutes.   - **Grubhub**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Seamless**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Caviar**: No fee.  - Siam Terrace contact details:   - Phone: (217) 367-8424   - Address: 212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801  - Opening hours: 11:00 AM - 10:00 PM.  - Siam Terrace serves \"Mock Duck Curry\" as part of their menu.  - The **HOME** page displays a welcome message for Siam Terrace, mentioning that they serve Thai and Japanese cuisine, including dishes like Pad Thai, Cashew Nut Chicken, and Mock Duck Curry.  - Cuisines offered include Thai, Sushi, Asian, Chicken, Curry, Grill, Salads, Soup, Seafood, Dessert, Wraps, Pasta, Noodles, Fish, and Wings.  - The restaurant is located near Urbana Free Library on Main Street and offers online ordering for carryout or delivery.  - Customer reviews summary:   - Positive feedback:    - Delicious dishes like Pad Thai, mock duck curry, and drunken noodles.    - Friendly and attentive service.    - Extensive vegan and vegetarian options.    - Reasonable prices.    - Welcoming atmosphere.   - Negative feedback: None explicitly mentioned in the summarized reviews.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When accessing menus or dropdowns, ensure that the desired option is visible or accessible after tapping the menu button to avoid unnecessary retries.  5. If an action does not yield the expected result (e.g., tapping a button does not navigate to the desired page), consider swiping or exploring alternative navigation options before retrying the same action.  6. If swiping does not reveal the desired content, consider combining swiping with tapping on specific areas of the screen to navigate to hidden elements.  7. When retrying a failed action, ensure that the screen state has changed or refreshed to avoid repeating the same error.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL\" has been completed.  - A restaurant named **Siam Terrace** is displayed with the following details:   - Rating: 4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)   - Price range: $10\u201320   - Cuisine: Thai   - Status: Closed (Opens at 11 AM)   - Distance: 1.3 miles   - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - The menu or ordering options for Siam Terrace have been accessed.  - Ordering platforms available for Siam Terrace include:   - **Menufy**: Service fee $1.75, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Storefront by DoorDash**: No fee, ready in 14\u201320 minutes.   - **EatStreet**: No fee, ready in 7 minutes.   - **Grubhub**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Seamless**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Caviar**: No fee.  - Siam Terrace contact details:   - Phone: (217) 367-8424   - Address: 212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801  - Opening hours: 11:00 AM - 10:00 PM.  - Siam Terrace serves \"Mock Duck Curry\" as part of their menu.  - The **HOME** page displays a welcome message for Siam Terrace, mentioning that they serve Thai and Japanese cuisine, including dishes like Pad Thai, Cashew Nut Chicken, and Mock Duck Curry.  - Cuisines offered include Thai, Sushi, Asian, Chicken, Curry, Grill, Salads, Soup, Seafood, Dessert, Wraps, Pasta, Noodles, Fish, and Wings.  - The restaurant is located near Urbana Free Library on Main Street and offers online ordering for carryout or delivery.  - Customer reviews summary:   - Positive feedback:    - Delicious dishes like Pad Thai, mock duck curry, and drunken noodles.    - Friendly and attentive service.    - Extensive vegan and vegetarian options.    - Reasonable prices.    - Welcoming atmosphere.   - Negative feedback: None explicitly mentioned in the summarized reviews.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Review customer comments and compile a summary of positive and negative feedback in Notes.\n\n### Overall Plan ###\nThe current plan remains valid: 1. Open the Google Maps app. 2. Search for \"Siam Terrace Urbana, IL.\" 3. Navigate to the restaurant's page on Google Maps. 4. Access the \"Reviews\" section. 5. Read customer reviews and summarize the positive and negative feedback. 6. Open the Notes app and compile the summary.\n\n### Progress Status ###\nThe home screen has been successfully accessed. Proceed to open the Notes app to compile the summary of customer feedback.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nOpen the Notes app and compile the summary of positive and negative feedback.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nThe most recent actions you took and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: I will open the Google Maps app to search for Siam Terrace and access its reviews section.

This will allow me to analyze the reviews and summarize the positive and negative feedback. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will return to the home screen to prepare for opening the Notes app, where I will compile the summary of customer feedback. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe left to navigate to the next page of the home screen to locate the Notes app. This action is necessary because the app is not visible on the current screen. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action intended to navigate to the next page of the home screen to locate the Notes app. However, instead of moving to the next home screen, the action opened a search interface, which is not the expected result. This could have been caused by an unintended gesture or misinterpretation of the swipe action.\n\nNOTE: Since the last action failed and resulted in an incorrect page, I have reverted the phone state to its previous state for you.\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone. Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better perceive the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When accessing menus or dropdowns, ensure that the desired option is visible or accessible after tapping the menu button to avoid unnecessary retries.  5. If an action does not yield the expected result (e.g., tapping a button does not navigate to the desired page), consider swiping or exploring alternative navigation options before retrying the same action.  6. If swiping does not reveal the desired content, consider combining swiping with tapping on specific areas of the screen to navigate to hidden elements.  7. When retrying a failed action, ensure that the screen state has changed or refreshed to avoid repeating the same error.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL\" has been completed.  - A restaurant named **Siam Terrace** is displayed with the following details:   - Rating: 4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)   - Price range: $10\u201320   - Cuisine: Thai   - Status: Closed (Opens at 11 AM)   - Distance: 1.3 miles   - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - The menu or ordering options for Siam Terrace have been accessed.  - Ordering platforms available for Siam Terrace include:   - **Menufy**: Service fee $1.75, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Storefront by DoorDash**: No fee, ready in 14\u201320 minutes.   - **EatStreet**: No fee, ready in 7 minutes.   - **Grubhub**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Seamless**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Caviar**: No fee.  - Siam Terrace contact details:   - Phone: (217) 367-8424   - Address: 212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801  - Opening hours: 11:00 AM - 10:00 PM.  - Siam Terrace serves \"Mock Duck Curry\" as part of their menu.  - The **HOME** page displays a welcome message for Siam Terrace, mentioning that they serve Thai and Japanese cuisine, including dishes like Pad Thai, Cashew Nut Chicken, and Mock Duck Curry.  - Cuisines offered include Thai, Sushi, Asian, Chicken, Curry, Grill, Salads, Soup, Seafood, Dessert, Wraps, Pasta, Noodles, Fish, and Wings.  - The restaurant is located near Urbana Free Library on Main Street and offers online ordering for carryout or delivery.  - Customer reviews summary:   - Positive feedback:    - Delicious dishes like Pad Thai, mock duck curry, and drunken noodles.    - Friendly and attentive service.    - Extensive vegan and vegetarian options.    - Reasonable prices.    - Welcoming atmosphere.   - Negative feedback: None explicitly mentioned in the summarized reviews.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When accessing menus or dropdowns, ensure that the desired option is visible or accessible after tapping the menu button to avoid unnecessary retries.  5. If an action does not yield the expected result (e.g., tapping a button does not navigate to the desired page), consider swiping or exploring alternative navigation options before retrying the same action.  6. If swiping does not reveal the desired content, consider combining swiping with tapping on specific areas of the screen to navigate to hidden elements.  7. When retrying a failed action, ensure that the screen state has changed or refreshed to avoid repeating the same error.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL\" has been completed.  - A restaurant named **Siam Terrace** is displayed with the following details:   - Rating: 4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)   - Price range: $10\u201320   - Cuisine: Thai   - Status: Closed (Opens at 11 AM)   - Distance: 1.3 miles   - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - The menu or ordering options for Siam Terrace have been accessed.  - Ordering platforms available for Siam Terrace include:   - **Menufy**: Service fee $1.75, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Storefront by DoorDash**: No fee, ready in 14\u201320 minutes.   - **EatStreet**: No fee, ready in 7 minutes.   - **Grubhub**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Seamless**: No fee, ready in 20 minutes.   - **Caviar**: No fee.  - Siam Terrace contact details:   - Phone: (217) 367-8424   - Address: 212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801  - Opening hours: 11:00 AM - 10:00 PM.  - Siam Terrace serves \"Mock Duck Curry\" as part of their menu.  - The **HOME** page displays a welcome message for Siam Terrace, mentioning that they serve Thai and Japanese cuisine, including dishes like Pad Thai, Cashew Nut Chicken, and Mock Duck Curry.  - Cuisines offered include Thai, Sushi, Asian, Chicken, Curry, Grill, Salads, Soup, Seafood, Dessert, Wraps, Pasta, Noodles, Fish, and Wings.  - The restaurant is located near Urbana Free Library on Main Street and offers online ordering for carryout or delivery.  - Customer reviews summary:   - Positive feedback:    - Delicious dishes like Pad Thai, mock duck curry, and drunken noodles.    - Friendly and attentive service.    - Extensive vegan and vegetarian options.    - Reasonable prices.    - Welcoming atmosphere.   - Negative feedback: None explicitly mentioned in the summarized reviews.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

This could have been caused by an unintended gesture or misinterpretation of the swipe action.\n- Attempt 19: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe left to navigate to the next page of the home screen to locate the Notes app. This is required because the app is not visible on the current screen. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action intended to navigate to the next page of the home screen did not result in any visible change. The screen after the action does not show the Notes app or any new page of apps. Instead, it appears to have opened a search interface, which was not the intended outcome.\n- Attempt 20: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 695, 'y': 699}} | Description: I will tap the \"Close\" button to exit the search interface and return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The \"Close\" button was tapped, but the search interface remains open, as evidenced by the unchanged screen content. The expected behavior of returning to the home screen did not occur. This could be due to the tap not being registered correctly or a system issue preventing the interface from closing.\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded. The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option: Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option: Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content: Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap: Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here. Otherwise, keep the current plan and copy it here.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nThe next subgoal to work on. If the previous subgoal is not yet complete, copy it here. If all subgoals are completed, write \"Finished\".\n",
