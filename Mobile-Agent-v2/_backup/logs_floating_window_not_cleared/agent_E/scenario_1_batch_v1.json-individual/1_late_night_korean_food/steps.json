You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here. Otherwise, keep the current plan and copy it here.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nThe next subgoal to work on. If the previous subgoal is not yet complete, copy it here. If all subgoals are completed, write \"Finished\".\n",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar atomic action sequences are not included.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n### Updated Tips ###\nIf you have any important new tips to add (not already included in the existing tips), combine them with the current list. If there are no new tips, simply copy the existing tips here. Keep your tips concise and general. IMPORTANT: DO NOT create shortcut names that do not exist. Add new tips only if they are essential for future interactions.\n",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. 1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error. 3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error. 3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. 1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error. 3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6. Description: \"Authentic flavorful Korean food with...\"   - **GG HotPot \u4e45\u9999\u706b\u9505**: Rating 4.1.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error. 3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here.

This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" This indicates that the tap action on the \"Rating\" option was either not executed correctly or the system did not register the input.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu to change the sorting criteria. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: Instead of changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating,\" the action navigated to a specific restaurant's details page (\"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant\"). This indicates that the tap action was performed on a restaurant listing rather than the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu again to reopen the sorting options. This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2142}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the \"Relevance\" option in the \"Sort by\" menu to select \"Rating\" as the sorting criterion. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The expected reordering of results based on ratings did not occur. This failure could be due to an incorrect tap location or the system not registering the tap properly.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2100}} | Description: I will tap slightly above the previous tap location to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" to reorder the results. However, the screen after the action shows the details of \"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant,\" indicating that the tap action selected a restaurant instead of the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This suggests that the tap was misaligned or the dropdown menu was not properly engaged.\n\nNOTE: Since the last action failed and resulted in an incorrect page, I have reverted the phone state to its previous state for you.\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. 1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error. 3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6. Description: \"Authentic flavorful Korean food with...\"   - **GG HotPot \u4e45\u9999\u706b\u9505**: Rating 4.1.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Consider the following:\n(1) Are there any sequences of actions that occurred repeatedly and can be consolidated into new \"shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions.\n(2) Are there any general tips that might be useful for handling future tasks, such as advice on preventing certain common errors?\n\nProvide your output in the following format containing two parts:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar atomic action sequences are not included.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n### Updated Tips ###\nIf you have any important new tips to add (not already included in the existing tips), combine them with the current list. If there are no new tips, simply copy the existing tips here. Keep your tips concise and general. IMPORTANT: DO NOT create shortcut names that do not exist.

Open the Google Maps app. \u2705  2. Search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL.\" \u2705  3. Apply a filter to show only restaurants open after 9 PM. \u2705  4. Sort the results by rating to find the best-rated restaurant.  5. Note the name and details of the best-rated restaurant.\n\n### Progress Status ###\nThe sorting options have been successfully reopened. The next step is to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" to identify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nChange the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" to identify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nThe most recent actions you took and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu to change the sorting criteria. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: Instead of changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating,\" the action navigated to a specific restaurant's details page (\"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant\"). This indicates that the tap action was performed on a restaurant listing rather than the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu again to reopen the sorting options. This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2142}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the \"Relevance\" option in the \"Sort by\" menu to select \"Rating\" as the sorting criterion. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The expected reordering of results based on ratings did not occur. This failure could be due to an incorrect tap location or the system not registering the tap properly.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2100}} | Description: I will tap slightly above the previous tap location to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" to reorder the results. However, the screen after the action shows the details of \"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant,\" indicating that the tap action selected a restaurant instead of the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This suggests that the tap was misaligned or the dropdown menu was not properly engaged.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu to reopen the sorting options. This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Successful\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

This failure could be due to an incorrect tap location or the system not registering the tap properly.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2100}} | Description: I will tap slightly above the previous tap location to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The expected reordering of results based on ratings did not occur. This failure could be due to an incorrect tap location or the system not registering the tap properly.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2100}} | Description: I will tap slightly above the previous tap location to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" to reorder the results. However, the screen after the action shows the details of \"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant,\" indicating that the tap action selected a restaurant instead of the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This suggests that the tap was misaligned or the dropdown menu was not properly engaged.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu to reopen the sorting options.

This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" as indicated by the checkmark next to \"Relevance\" in the dropdown menu. The action to select \"Rating\" did not succeed, likely because the tap was not accurately positioned on the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\nAction: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2130}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2130). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\n\nNOTE: Since the last action failed and did not have any effect, the state of the phone remains unchanged.\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" This indicates that the tap action on the \"Rating\" option was either not executed correctly or the system did not register the input.\n- Attempt 10: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu to change the sorting criteria. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: Instead of changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating,\" the action navigated to a specific restaurant's details page (\"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant\"). This indicates that the tap action was performed on a restaurant listing rather than the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 11: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu again to reopen the sorting options. This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 12: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2142}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the \"Relevance\" option in the \"Sort by\" menu to select \"Rating\" as the sorting criterion. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The expected reordering of results based on ratings did not occur. This failure could be due to an incorrect tap location or the system not registering the tap properly.\n- Attempt 13: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2100}} | Description: I will tap slightly above the previous tap location to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" to reorder the results. However, the screen after the action shows the details of \"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant,\" indicating that the tap action selected a restaurant instead of the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This suggests that the tap was misaligned or the dropdown menu was not properly engaged.\n- Attempt 14: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu to reopen the sorting options. This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 15: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2130}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the \"Relevance\" option in the dropdown menu to select \"Rating\" as the sorting criterion. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" as indicated by the checkmark next to \"Relevance\" in the dropdown menu. The action to select \"Rating\" did not succeed, likely because the tap was not accurately positioned on the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 16: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2130}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2130). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\n- Attempt 17: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2180}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu did not result in any visible changes. The sorting criteria remains unchanged, and the results are still not sorted by rating. This suggests that the tap did not successfully interact with the intended \"Rating\" option.\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2130}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the \"Relevance\" option in the dropdown menu to select \"Rating\" as the sorting criterion. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" as indicated by the checkmark next to \"Relevance\" in the dropdown menu. The action to select \"Rating\" did not succeed, likely because the tap was not accurately positioned on the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\nAction: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2130}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2130). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2180}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu did not result in any visible changes. The sorting criteria remains unchanged, and the results are still not sorted by rating. This suggests that the tap did not successfully interact with the intended \"Rating\" option.\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will use the \"Back\" action to return to the previous screen, which contains the search results for Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. This will allow me to continue working on sorting the results by rating. | Outcome: Successful\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Change the sorting criteria to \"Rating.\"  5. Manually analyze the visible restaurant ratings and details to identify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant.  6. Note the name and details of the best-rated restaurant.\n\n### Previous Subgoal ###\nChange the sorting criteria to \"Rating.\"\n\n### Progress Status ###\nThe sorting options have been successfully reopened. The next step is to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" to identify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant.\n\n### Important Notes ###\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6. Description: \"Authentic flavorful Korean food with...\"   - **GG HotPot \u4e45\u9999\u706b\u9505**: Rating 4.1.

Here are some logs:\n- Attempt 1: Action: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: This action will open the Google Maps app, allowing me to proceed with searching for late-night Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 2: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 351, 'y': 1907}} | Description: I will tap the \"No thanks\" button to dismiss the pop-up and clear the screen for further actions, such as searching for Korean restaurants. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 3: Action: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 449, 'y': 174, 'text': 'Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL,\" and execute the search to display relevant results. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 4: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 607, 'y': 956}} | Description: I will tap the \"Open now\" button to access the filter options and adjust them to show restaurants open after 9 PM. This will help narrow down the search results to meet the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 5: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap the \"Relevance\" button to open the sorting options, allowing me to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" and identify the best-rated restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 6: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option in the sorting menu to change the sorting criteria. This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" This indicates that the tap action on the \"Rating\" option was either not executed correctly or the system did not register the input. The expected reordering of results based on ratings did not occur.\n- Attempt 7: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option again to change the sorting criteria and reorder the results by rating. This will help identify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping at the specified coordinates did not change the sorting criteria to \"Rating.\" Instead, it navigated to the details page of a specific restaurant, \"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant.\" This indicates that the tap was misaligned or incorrectly targeted, leading to an unintended navigation.\n- Attempt 8: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu to reopen the sorting options. This is the first step in changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating.\" | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 9: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Rating\" option in the sorting menu to change the sorting criterion. This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" This indicates that the tap action on the \"Rating\" option was either not executed correctly or the system did not register the input.\n- Attempt 10: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu to change the sorting criteria. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: Instead of changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating,\" the action navigated to a specific restaurant's details page (\"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant\"). This indicates that the tap action was performed on a restaurant listing rather than the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 11: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu again to reopen the sorting options. This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 12: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2142}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the \"Relevance\" option in the \"Sort by\" menu to select \"Rating\" as the sorting criterion. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The expected reordering of results based on ratings did not occur. This failure could be due to an incorrect tap location or the system not registering the tap properly.\n- Attempt 13: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2100}} | Description: I will tap slightly above the previous tap location to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" to reorder the results. However, the screen after the action shows the details of \"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant,\" indicating that the tap action selected a restaurant instead of the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This suggests that the tap was misaligned or the dropdown menu was not properly engaged.\n- Attempt 14: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu to reopen the sorting options. This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 15: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2130}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the \"Relevance\" option in the dropdown menu to select \"Rating\" as the sorting criterion. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" as indicated by the checkmark next to \"Relevance\" in the dropdown menu. The action to select \"Rating\" did not succeed, likely because the tap was not accurately positioned on the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 16: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2130}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2130). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\n- Attempt 17: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2180}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu did not result in any visible changes. The sorting criteria remains unchanged, and the results are still not sorted by rating. This suggests that the tap did not successfully interact with the intended \"Rating\" option.\n- Attempt 18: Action: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will use the \"Back\" action to return to the previous screen, which contains the search results for Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. This will allow me to continue working on sorting the results by rating. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 19: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2100}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2100). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\n- Attempt 20: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2080}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2080). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\n- Attempt 21: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2060}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2060). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure in registering the tap action.\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded.

Instead, I will revise the plan to manually analyze the visible results and identify the best-rated restaurant based on the available information. ### Updated Plan ### 1. Review the visible search results for Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. 2. Identify the best-rated restaurant that is open late (beyond 9 PM) and serves Korean cuisine. 3. Note the name, rating, and other relevant details of the selected restaurant.\n\n### Progress Status ###\nThe sorting options have been successfully reopened. The next step is to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" to identify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nIdentify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant from the visible results and confirm if it meets the user's requirements.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nThe most recent actions you took and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2180}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu did not result in any visible changes. The sorting criteria remains unchanged, and the results are still not sorted by rating. This suggests that the tap did not successfully interact with the intended \"Rating\" option.\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will use the \"Back\" action to return to the previous screen, which contains the search results for Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. This will allow me to continue working on sorting the results by rating. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2100}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2100). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\nAction: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2080}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2080). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\nAction: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2060}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2060). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure in registering the tap action.\n\nNOTE: Since the last action failed and did not have any effect, the state of the phone remains unchanged.\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option: Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here.

This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure in registering the tap action.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to review more results and check if there are other Korean restaurants with high ratings that are open late.

This suggests that the tap action was misinterpreted or misplaced, leading to the selection of a specific restaurant rather than the dropdown menu.\n\nNOTE: Since the last action failed and resulted in an incorrect page, I have reverted the phone state to its previous state for you.\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Here are some logs:\n- Attempt 1: Action: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: This action will open the Google Maps app, allowing me to proceed with searching for late-night Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 2: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 351, 'y': 1907}} | Description: I will tap the \"No thanks\" button to dismiss the pop-up and clear the screen for further actions, such as searching for Korean restaurants. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 3: Action: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 449, 'y': 174, 'text': 'Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL,\" and execute the search to display relevant results. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 4: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 607, 'y': 956}} | Description: I will tap the \"Open now\" button to access the filter options and adjust them to show restaurants open after 9 PM. This will help narrow down the search results to meet the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 5: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap the \"Relevance\" button to open the sorting options, allowing me to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" and identify the best-rated restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 6: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option in the sorting menu to change the sorting criteria. This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" This indicates that the tap action on the \"Rating\" option was either not executed correctly or the system did not register the input. The expected reordering of results based on ratings did not occur.\n- Attempt 7: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option again to change the sorting criteria and reorder the results by rating. This will help identify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping at the specified coordinates did not change the sorting criteria to \"Rating.\" Instead, it navigated to the details page of a specific restaurant, \"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant.\" This indicates that the tap was misaligned or incorrectly targeted, leading to an unintended navigation.\n- Attempt 8: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu to reopen the sorting options. This is the first step in changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating.\" | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 9: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Rating\" option in the sorting menu to change the sorting criterion. This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" This indicates that the tap action on the \"Rating\" option was either not executed correctly or the system did not register the input.\n- Attempt 10: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu to change the sorting criteria. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: Instead of changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating,\" the action navigated to a specific restaurant's details page (\"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant\"). This indicates that the tap action was performed on a restaurant listing rather than the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 11: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu again to reopen the sorting options. This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 12: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2142}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the \"Relevance\" option in the \"Sort by\" menu to select \"Rating\" as the sorting criterion. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The expected reordering of results based on ratings did not occur. This failure could be due to an incorrect tap location or the system not registering the tap properly.\n- Attempt 13: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2100}} | Description: I will tap slightly above the previous tap location to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" to reorder the results. However, the screen after the action shows the details of \"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant,\" indicating that the tap action selected a restaurant instead of the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This suggests that the tap was misaligned or the dropdown menu was not properly engaged.\n- Attempt 14: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu to reopen the sorting options. This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 15: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2130}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the \"Relevance\" option in the dropdown menu to select \"Rating\" as the sorting criterion. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" as indicated by the checkmark next to \"Relevance\" in the dropdown menu. The action to select \"Rating\" did not succeed, likely because the tap was not accurately positioned on the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 16: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2130}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2130). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\n- Attempt 17: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2180}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu did not result in any visible changes. The sorting criteria remains unchanged, and the results are still not sorted by rating.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

This will help narrow down the search results to meet the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 5: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap the \"Relevance\" button to open the sorting options, allowing me to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" and identify the best-rated restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 6: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option in the sorting menu to change the sorting criteria. This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" This indicates that the tap action on the \"Rating\" option was either not executed correctly or the system did not register the input. The expected reordering of results based on ratings did not occur.\n- Attempt 7: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option again to change the sorting criteria and reorder the results by rating. This will help identify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping at the specified coordinates did not change the sorting criteria to \"Rating.\" Instead, it navigated to the details page of a specific restaurant, \"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant.\" This indicates that the tap was misaligned or incorrectly targeted, leading to an unintended navigation.\n- Attempt 8: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu to reopen the sorting options. This is the first step in changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating.\" | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 9: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Rating\" option in the sorting menu to change the sorting criterion. This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" This indicates that the tap action on the \"Rating\" option was either not executed correctly or the system did not register the input.\n- Attempt 10: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu to change the sorting criteria. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: Instead of changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating,\" the action navigated to a specific restaurant's details page (\"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant\"). This indicates that the tap action was performed on a restaurant listing rather than the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 11: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu again to reopen the sorting options. This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 12: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2142}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the \"Relevance\" option in the \"Sort by\" menu to select \"Rating\" as the sorting criterion. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The expected reordering of results based on ratings did not occur. This failure could be due to an incorrect tap location or the system not registering the tap properly.\n- Attempt 13: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2100}} | Description: I will tap slightly above the previous tap location to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" to reorder the results. However, the screen after the action shows the details of \"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant,\" indicating that the tap action selected a restaurant instead of the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This suggests that the tap was misaligned or the dropdown menu was not properly engaged.\n- Attempt 14: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu to reopen the sorting options. This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 15: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2130}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the \"Relevance\" option in the dropdown menu to select \"Rating\" as the sorting criterion. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" as indicated by the checkmark next to \"Relevance\" in the dropdown menu. The action to select \"Rating\" did not succeed, likely because the tap was not accurately positioned on the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 16: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2130}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2130). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\n- Attempt 17: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2180}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu did not result in any visible changes. The sorting criteria remains unchanged, and the results are still not sorted by rating. This suggests that the tap did not successfully interact with the intended \"Rating\" option.\n- Attempt 18: Action: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will use the \"Back\" action to return to the previous screen, which contains the search results for Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. This will allow me to continue working on sorting the results by rating. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 19: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2100}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2100). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\n- Attempt 20: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2080}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2080). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\n- Attempt 21: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2060}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2060). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure in registering the tap action.\n- Attempt 22: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to review more results and check if there are other Korean restaurants with high ratings that are open late. This will help ensure that I find a restaurant that meets the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 23: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to reveal more results and check if there are other Korean restaurants with high ratings that are open late (beyond 9 PM). This will help identify a restaurant that meets the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 24: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to reveal more results and check if there are other Korean restaurants with high ratings that are open late (beyond 9 PM). This will help identify a restaurant that meets the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not reveal any new results. The visible content on the screen before and after the swipe remains the same, indicating that the action did not produce the expected behavior of revealing more results.\n- Attempt 25: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2060}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2060). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top, making it easier to identify a late-night Korean restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu and select the \"Rating\" option to reorder the results. However, the screenshots and extracted data indicate that the app navigated to the details page of \"Industrial Donut\" instead. This suggests that the tap action was misinterpreted or misplaced, leading to the selection of a specific restaurant rather than the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 26: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2050}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2050). Adjusting the tap position slightly should help ensure the correct option is selected. This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top, making it easier to identify a suitable late-night Korean restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu and select the \"Rating\" option to reorder the results. However, the screenshots and extracted information indicate that the screen now displays details for \"Industrial Donut,\" which is unrelated to the intended action. This suggests that the tap coordinates may have been incorrect, leading to the selection of a specific restaurant instead of the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 27: Action: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will navigate back to the previous screen to return to the search results for Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. This will allow me to continue reviewing the results and identify a suitable late-night option. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The \"Back\" action did not navigate to the previous screen as expected. Instead, the screen remains on the details page for \"Industrial Donut.\" This indicates that the \"Back\" action was either not executed properly or did not function as intended.\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded.

This will help identify a restaurant that meets the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not reveal any new results. The visible content on the screen before and after the swipe remains the same, indicating that the action did not produce the expected behavior of revealing more results.\nAction: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2060}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2060). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top, making it easier to identify a late-night Korean restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu and select the \"Rating\" option to reorder the results. However, the screenshots and extracted data indicate that the app navigated to the details page of \"Industrial Donut\" instead. This suggests that the tap action was misinterpreted or misplaced, leading to the selection of a specific restaurant rather than the dropdown menu.\nAction: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2050}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2050). Adjusting the tap position slightly should help ensure the correct option is selected. This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top, making it easier to identify a suitable late-night Korean restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu and select the \"Rating\" option to reorder the results. However, the screenshots and extracted information indicate that the screen now displays details for \"Industrial Donut,\" which is unrelated to the intended action. This suggests that the tap coordinates may have been incorrect, leading to the selection of a specific restaurant instead of the dropdown menu.\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will navigate back to the previous screen to return to the search results for Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. This will allow me to continue reviewing the results and identify a suitable late-night option. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The \"Back\" action did not navigate to the previous screen as expected. Instead, the screen remains on the details page for \"Industrial Donut.\" This indicates that the \"Back\" action was either not executed properly or did not function as intended.\n\nNOTE: Since the last action failed and did not have any effect, the state of the phone remains unchanged.\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

However, the screenshots and extracted data indicate that the app navigated to the details page of \"Industrial Donut\" instead.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top, making it easier to identify a late-night Korean restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu and select the \"Rating\" option to reorder the results. However, the screenshots and extracted data indicate that the app navigated to the details page of \"Industrial Donut\" instead. This suggests that the tap action was misinterpreted or misplaced, leading to the selection of a specific restaurant rather than the dropdown menu.\nAction: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2050}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2050). Adjusting the tap position slightly should help ensure the correct option is selected. This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top, making it easier to identify a suitable late-night Korean restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu and select the \"Rating\" option to reorder the results. However, the screenshots and extracted information indicate that the screen now displays details for \"Industrial Donut,\" which is unrelated to the intended action. This suggests that the tap coordinates may have been incorrect, leading to the selection of a specific restaurant instead of the dropdown menu.\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will navigate back to the previous screen to return to the search results for Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. This will allow me to continue reviewing the results and identify a suitable late-night option. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The \"Back\" action did not navigate to the previous screen as expected. Instead, the screen remains on the details page for \"Industrial Donut.\" This indicates that the \"Back\" action was either not executed properly or did not function as intended.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 978, 'y': 202}} | Description: I will tap the \"\u00d7\" icon at the top-right corner of the screen to close the current page and return to the search results for Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL.

This action is intended to load additional Korean restaurants that may meet the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not result in any new search results being revealed. The visible content on the screen before and after the action remains the same, indicating that the swipe did not load additional results or move the view.\n\nNOTE: Since the last action failed and did not have any effect, the state of the phone remains unchanged.\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Here are some logs:\n- Attempt 1: Action: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: This action will open the Google Maps app, allowing me to proceed with searching for late-night Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 2: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 351, 'y': 1907}} | Description: I will tap the \"No thanks\" button to dismiss the pop-up and clear the screen for further actions, such as searching for Korean restaurants. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 3: Action: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 449, 'y': 174, 'text': 'Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL,\" and execute the search to display relevant results. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 4: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 607, 'y': 956}} | Description: I will tap the \"Open now\" button to access the filter options and adjust them to show restaurants open after 9 PM. This will help narrow down the search results to meet the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 5: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap the \"Relevance\" button to open the sorting options, allowing me to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" and identify the best-rated restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 6: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option in the sorting menu to change the sorting criteria. This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" This indicates that the tap action on the \"Rating\" option was either not executed correctly or the system did not register the input. The expected reordering of results based on ratings did not occur.\n- Attempt 7: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option again to change the sorting criteria and reorder the results by rating. This will help identify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping at the specified coordinates did not change the sorting criteria to \"Rating.\" Instead, it navigated to the details page of a specific restaurant, \"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant.\" This indicates that the tap was misaligned or incorrectly targeted, leading to an unintended navigation.\n- Attempt 8: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu to reopen the sorting options. This is the first step in changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating.\" | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 9: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Rating\" option in the sorting menu to change the sorting criterion. This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" This indicates that the tap action on the \"Rating\" option was either not executed correctly or the system did not register the input.\n- Attempt 10: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu to change the sorting criteria. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: Instead of changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating,\" the action navigated to a specific restaurant's details page (\"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant\"). This indicates that the tap action was performed on a restaurant listing rather than the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 11: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu again to reopen the sorting options. This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 12: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2142}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the \"Relevance\" option in the \"Sort by\" menu to select \"Rating\" as the sorting criterion. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The expected reordering of results based on ratings did not occur. This failure could be due to an incorrect tap location or the system not registering the tap properly.\n- Attempt 13: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2100}} | Description: I will tap slightly above the previous tap location to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" to reorder the results. However, the screen after the action shows the details of \"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant,\" indicating that the tap action selected a restaurant instead of the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This suggests that the tap was misaligned or the dropdown menu was not properly engaged.\n- Attempt 14: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu to reopen the sorting options. This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 15: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2130}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the \"Relevance\" option in the dropdown menu to select \"Rating\" as the sorting criterion. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" as indicated by the checkmark next to \"Relevance\" in the dropdown menu. The action to select \"Rating\" did not succeed, likely because the tap was not accurately positioned on the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 16: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2130}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2130). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\n- Attempt 17: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2180}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu did not result in any visible changes. The sorting criteria remains unchanged, and the results are still not sorted by rating. This suggests that the tap did not successfully interact with the intended \"Rating\" option.\n- Attempt 18: Action: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will use the \"Back\" action to return to the previous screen, which contains the search results for Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. This will allow me to continue working on sorting the results by rating. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 19: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2100}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2100). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\n- Attempt 20: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2080}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2080). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\n- Attempt 21: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2060}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2060). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure in registering the tap action.\n- Attempt 22: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to review more results and check if there are other Korean restaurants with high ratings that are open late. This will help ensure that I find a restaurant that meets the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 23: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to reveal more results and check if there are other Korean restaurants with high ratings that are open late (beyond 9 PM). This will help identify a restaurant that meets the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 24: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to reveal more results and check if there are other Korean restaurants with high ratings that are open late (beyond 9 PM). This will help identify a restaurant that meets the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not reveal any new results. The visible content on the screen before and after the swipe remains the same, indicating that the action did not produce the expected behavior of revealing more results.\n- Attempt 25: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2060}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2060). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top, making it easier to identify a late-night Korean restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu and select the \"Rating\" option to reorder the results. However, the screenshots and extracted data indicate that the app navigated to the details page of \"Industrial Donut\" instead. This suggests that the tap action was misinterpreted or misplaced, leading to the selection of a specific restaurant rather than the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 26: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2050}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2050). Adjusting the tap position slightly should help ensure the correct option is selected. This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top, making it easier to identify a suitable late-night Korean restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu and select the \"Rating\" option to reorder the results. However, the screenshots and extracted information indicate that the screen now displays details for \"Industrial Donut,\" which is unrelated to the intended action. This suggests that the tap coordinates may have been incorrect, leading to the selection of a specific restaurant instead of the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 27: Action: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will navigate back to the previous screen to return to the search results for Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. This will allow me to continue reviewing the results and identify a suitable late-night option. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The \"Back\" action did not navigate to the previous screen as expected. Instead, the screen remains on the details page for \"Industrial Donut.\" This indicates that the \"Back\" action was either not executed properly or did not function as intended.\n- Attempt 28: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 978, 'y': 202}} | Description: I will tap the \"\u00d7\" icon at the top-right corner of the screen to close the current page and return to the search results for Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. This will allow me to continue reviewing the results to find the best-rated late-night option. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 29: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1800, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 200}} | Description: I will swipe up from near the bottom of the screen to the top to reveal more search results. This action is intended to load additional Korean restaurants that may meet the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not result in any new search results being revealed. The visible content on the screen before and after the action remains the same, indicating that the swipe did not load additional results or move the view.\n- Attempt 30: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1800, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 400}} | Description: I will swipe up from near the bottom of the screen to the top to load more search results. This action is intended to reveal additional Korean restaurants that may meet the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not result in any new search results being loaded.

This action is intended to reveal additional Korean restaurants that may meet the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action intended to load more search results did not produce any visible changes. The same results (\"The Courier Cafe\" and \"Industrial Donut\") are still displayed, and no additional Korean restaurants have been revealed.\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

This will help narrow down the search results to meet the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 5: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap the \"Relevance\" button to open the sorting options, allowing me to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" and identify the best-rated restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 6: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option in the sorting menu to change the sorting criteria. This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" This indicates that the tap action on the \"Rating\" option was either not executed correctly or the system did not register the input. The expected reordering of results based on ratings did not occur.\n- Attempt 7: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option again to change the sorting criteria and reorder the results by rating. This will help identify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping at the specified coordinates did not change the sorting criteria to \"Rating.\" Instead, it navigated to the details page of a specific restaurant, \"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant.\" This indicates that the tap was misaligned or incorrectly targeted, leading to an unintended navigation.\n- Attempt 8: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu to reopen the sorting options. This is the first step in changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating.\" | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 9: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Rating\" option in the sorting menu to change the sorting criterion. This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" This indicates that the tap action on the \"Rating\" option was either not executed correctly or the system did not register the input.\n- Attempt 10: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2092}} | Description: I will tap the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu to change the sorting criteria. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: Instead of changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating,\" the action navigated to a specific restaurant's details page (\"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant\"). This indicates that the tap action was performed on a restaurant listing rather than the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 11: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu again to reopen the sorting options. This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 12: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2142}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the \"Relevance\" option in the \"Sort by\" menu to select \"Rating\" as the sorting criterion. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The expected reordering of results based on ratings did not occur. This failure could be due to an incorrect tap location or the system not registering the tap properly.\n- Attempt 13: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2100}} | Description: I will tap slightly above the previous tap location to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to change the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" to reorder the results. However, the screen after the action shows the details of \"Urbana Garden Family Restaurant,\" indicating that the tap action selected a restaurant instead of the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This suggests that the tap was misaligned or the dropdown menu was not properly engaged.\n- Attempt 14: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 953}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu to reopen the sorting options. This is necessary to attempt changing the sorting criteria to \"Rating\" in the next step. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 15: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2130}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the \"Relevance\" option in the dropdown menu to select \"Rating\" as the sorting criterion. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criterion remains set to \"Relevance\" as indicated by the checkmark next to \"Relevance\" in the dropdown menu. The action to select \"Rating\" did not succeed, likely because the tap was not accurately positioned on the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 16: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2130}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2130). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\n- Attempt 17: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 285, 'y': 2180}} | Description: I will tap slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu. This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action of tapping slightly below the previous attempts to select the \"Rating\" option in the dropdown menu did not result in any visible changes. The sorting criteria remains unchanged, and the results are still not sorted by rating. This suggests that the tap did not successfully interact with the intended \"Rating\" option.\n- Attempt 18: Action: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will use the \"Back\" action to return to the previous screen, which contains the search results for Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. This will allow me to continue working on sorting the results by rating. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 19: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2100}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2100). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\n- Attempt 20: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2080}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2080). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was likely reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure to register the tap.\n- Attempt 21: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2060}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2060). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The sorting criteria remains set to \"Relevance\" instead of changing to \"Rating.\" The dropdown menu was reopened, but the \"Rating\" option was not successfully selected. This could be due to an incorrect tap location for the \"Rating\" option or a failure in registering the tap action.\n- Attempt 22: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to review more results and check if there are other Korean restaurants with high ratings that are open late. This will help ensure that I find a restaurant that meets the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 23: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to reveal more results and check if there are other Korean restaurants with high ratings that are open late (beyond 9 PM). This will help identify a restaurant that meets the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 24: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to reveal more results and check if there are other Korean restaurants with high ratings that are open late (beyond 9 PM). This will help identify a restaurant that meets the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not reveal any new results. The visible content on the screen before and after the swipe remains the same, indicating that the action did not produce the expected behavior of revealing more results.\n- Attempt 25: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2060}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2060). This should reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top, making it easier to identify a late-night Korean restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu and select the \"Rating\" option to reorder the results. However, the screenshots and extracted data indicate that the app navigated to the details page of \"Industrial Donut\" instead. This suggests that the tap action was misinterpreted or misplaced, leading to the selection of a specific restaurant rather than the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 26: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option', 'arguments': {'dropdown_x': 285, 'dropdown_y': 953, 'option_x': 285, 'option_y': 2050}} | Description: I will reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu by tapping at (285, 953) and then select the \"Rating\" option by tapping at (285, 2050). Adjusting the tap position slightly should help ensure the correct option is selected. This will reorder the results to display the best-rated restaurants at the top, making it easier to identify a suitable late-night Korean restaurant. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action intended to reopen the \"Relevance\" dropdown menu and select the \"Rating\" option to reorder the results. However, the screenshots and extracted information indicate that the screen now displays details for \"Industrial Donut,\" which is unrelated to the intended action. This suggests that the tap coordinates may have been incorrect, leading to the selection of a specific restaurant instead of the dropdown menu.\n- Attempt 27: Action: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will navigate back to the previous screen to return to the search results for Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. This will allow me to continue reviewing the results and identify a suitable late-night option. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The \"Back\" action did not navigate to the previous screen as expected. Instead, the screen remains on the details page for \"Industrial Donut.\" This indicates that the \"Back\" action was either not executed properly or did not function as intended.\n- Attempt 28: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 978, 'y': 202}} | Description: I will tap the \"\u00d7\" icon at the top-right corner of the screen to close the current page and return to the search results for Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL. This will allow me to continue reviewing the results to find the best-rated late-night option. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 29: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1800, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 200}} | Description: I will swipe up from near the bottom of the screen to the top to reveal more search results. This action is intended to load additional Korean restaurants that may meet the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not result in any new search results being revealed. The visible content on the screen before and after the action remains the same, indicating that the swipe did not load additional results or move the view.\n- Attempt 30: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1800, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 400}} | Description: I will swipe up from near the bottom of the screen to the top to load more search results. This action is intended to reveal additional Korean restaurants that may meet the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action did not result in any new search results being loaded.

This action is intended to reveal additional Korean restaurants that may meet the user's requirements. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The swipe action intended to load more search results did not produce any visible changes. The same results (\"The Courier Cafe\" and \"Industrial Donut\") are still displayed, and no additional Korean restaurants have been revealed.\n- Attempt 32: Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 2000, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 100}} | Description: I will perform a longer swipe from near the bottom of the screen to the top to load more search results.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When applying filters or settings in apps, ensure to confirm or save the changes before proceeding to the next step.  5. If a dropdown menu fails to register a selection, try reopening the menu and selecting the option again. Adjust the tap position slightly if necessary to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Korean restaurants in Champaign, IL\" has been executed.  - The following restaurants are visible in the results:   - **San Maru Korean Restaurant**: Rating 4.6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",
