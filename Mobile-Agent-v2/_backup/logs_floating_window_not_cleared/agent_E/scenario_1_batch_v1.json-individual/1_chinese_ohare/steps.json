You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option: Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option: Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content: Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap: Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y).

Next step: Check for recent posts about the signature dishes of \"New Star Restaurant\" or \"Duck Duck Goat\" on X.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars. Known for flavorful rice and top-notch noodles.  - **Duck Duck Goat**: Rated 4.7 stars. Described as a hip spot for elevated Chinese cuisine.  - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1 stars. A counter-serve chain specializing in build-your-own stir-fries and other classic Chinese dishes.  Next step: Check for recent posts about the signature dishes of \"New Star Restaurant\" or \"Duck Duck Goat\" on X.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars. Known for flavorful rice and top-notch noodles.  - **Duck Duck Goat**: Rated 4.7 stars. Described as a hip spot for elevated Chinese cuisine.  - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1 stars. A counter-serve chain specializing in build-your-own stir-fries and other classic Chinese dishes.  Next step: Check for recent posts about the signature dishes of \"New Star Restaurant\" or \"Duck Duck Goat\" on X.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars. Known for flavorful rice and top-notch noodles.  - **Duck Duck Goat**: Rated 4.7 stars. Described as a hip spot for elevated Chinese cuisine.  - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1 stars. A counter-serve chain specializing in build-your-own stir-fries and other classic Chinese dishes.  Next step: Check for recent posts about the signature dishes of \"New Star Restaurant\" or \"Duck Duck Goat\" on X.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Consider the following:\n(1) Are there any sequences of actions that occurred repeatedly and can be consolidated into new \"shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions.\n(2) Are there any general tips that might be useful for handling future tasks, such as advice on preventing certain common errors?\n\nProvide your output in the following format containing two parts:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar atomic action sequences are not included.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n### Updated Tips ###\nIf you have any important new tips to add (not already included in the existing tips), combine them with the current list. If there are no new tips, simply copy the existing tips here. Keep your tips concise and general. IMPORTANT: DO NOT create shortcut names that do not exist. Add new tips only if they are essential for future interactions.\n",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. 1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error. 3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it. 5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars. Known for flavorful rice and top-notch noodles.  - **Duck Duck Goat**: Rated 4.7 stars. Described as a hip spot for elevated Chinese cuisine.  - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1 stars. A counter-serve chain specializing in build-your-own stir-fries and other classic Chinese dishes.  Next step: Check for recent posts about the signature dishes of \"New Star Restaurant\" or \"Duck Duck Goat\" on X.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. 1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error. 3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it. 5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars. Known for flavorful rice and top-notch noodles.  - **Duck Duck Goat**: Rated 4.7 stars. Described as a hip spot for elevated Chinese cuisine.  - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1 stars.

Next step: Check for recent posts about the signature dishes of \"New Star Restaurant\" or \"Duck Duck Goat\" on X.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error. 3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it. 5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

This could be due to the app not being launched properly or a system issue preventing the action.\n- Attempt 5: Action: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, enabling me to attempt reopening the X app from the home screen. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 6: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 414, 'y': 1740}} | Description: This action will tap on the X app icon to open it, allowing me to proceed with searching for recent posts about the signature dishes of the selected restaurants. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 7: Action: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 258, 'y': 309, 'text': 'New Star Restaurant'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the X app, type \"New Star Restaurant,\" and press Enter to search for recent posts about the restaurant's signature dishes. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action attempted to search for \"New Star Restaurant\" on X, but instead of displaying search results, the app opened a text input field for creating a new post. This indicates that the search bar was not correctly identified or tapped, and the app misinterpreted the action as an attempt to compose a new post.\n- Attempt 8: Action: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will navigate back to the main screen of the X app, where the search bar should be visible. From there, I can attempt to search for \"New Star Restaurant\" again. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 9: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 268, 'y': 2123}} | Description: This action will tap the search icon at the bottom of the screen, which should open the search interface in the X app, allowing me to search for posts about the selected restaurants. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 10: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 268, 'y': 2125}} | Description: This action will tap the search icon at the bottom of the screen, opening the search interface in the X app. This will allow me to search for posts about \"New Star Restaurant.\" | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 11: Action: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 332, 'y': 159, 'text': 'New Star Restaurant'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"New Star Restaurant,\" and press Enter to search for recent posts about the restaurant's signature dishes on X. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The search for \"New Star Restaurant\" on X did not yield relevant results about the restaurant or its signature dishes. Instead, unrelated content, such as a hotel and other posts, is displayed. This indicates that the search query did not produce the expected results.\n- Attempt 12: Action: {'name': 'Reopen_App_And_Search', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'X', 'search_icon_x': 414, 'search_icon_y': 1740, 'search_bar_x': 332, 'search_bar_y': 159, 'search_text': 'New Star Restaurant'}} | Description: This action will reopen the X app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for \"New Star Restaurant\" to find recent posts about its signature dishes. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action attempted to search for \"New Star Restaurant\" on the X app. However, the screenshot after the action shows that the search bar is in a draft or input state, and the search query \"New Star Restaurant\" has not been fully entered or executed. The app is still waiting for the user to complete the input or confirm the search. The potential reason for this failure could be: 1. The search query was not fully entered or submitted. 2. The action to confirm the search (e.g., pressing \"Enter\" or tapping a search button) was not performed.\n- Attempt 13: Action: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 298, 'y': 307, 'text': 'New Star Restaurant'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"New Star Restaurant,\" and press Enter to execute the search for recent posts about the restaurant's signature dishes on X. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The text input field shows \"New StNew S\" instead of the intended \"New Star Restaurant.\" This indicates that the text was not entered correctly, likely due to a typing error or an issue with the input method. The search was not executed, as there is no indication of a search result or any change in the interface.\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded. The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option: Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option: Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content: Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap: Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y).

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. 1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error. 3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it. 4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it. 5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars. Known for flavorful rice and top-notch noodles.  - **Duck Duck Goat**: Rated 4.7 stars. Described as a hip spot for elevated Chinese cuisine.  - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1 stars. A counter-serve chain specializing in build-your-own stir-fries and other classic Chinese dishes.  Next step: Check for recent posts about the signature dishes of \"New Star Restaurant\" or \"Duck Duck Goat\" on X.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Consider the following:\n(1) Are there any sequences of actions that occurred repeatedly and can be consolidated into new \"shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions.\n(2) Are there any general tips that might be useful for handling future tasks, such as advice on preventing certain common errors?\n\nProvide your output in the following format containing two parts:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar atomic action sequences are not included.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n### Updated Tips ###\nIf you have any important new tips to add (not already included in the existing tips), combine them with the current list. If there are no new tips, simply copy the existing tips here. Keep your tips concise and general. IMPORTANT: DO NOT create shortcut names that do not exist. Add new tips only if they are essential for future interactions.\n",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars. Known for flavorful rice and top-notch noodles.  - **Duck Duck Goat**: Rated 4.7 stars. Described as a hip spot for elevated Chinese cuisine.  - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1 stars. A counter-serve chain specializing in build-your-own stir-fries and other classic Chinese dishes.  Next step: Check for recent posts about the signature dishes of \"New Star Restaurant\" or \"Duck Duck Goat\" on X.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Instead, unrelated content, such as a hotel and other posts, is displayed. This indicates that the search query did not produce the expected results.\nAction: {'name': 'Reopen_App_And_Search', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'X', 'search_icon_x': 414, 'search_icon_y': 1740, 'search_bar_x': 332, 'search_bar_y': 159, 'search_text': 'New Star Restaurant'}} | Description: This action will reopen the X app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for \"New Star Restaurant\" to find recent posts about its signature dishes. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action attempted to search for \"New Star Restaurant\" on the X app. However, the screenshot after the action shows that the search bar is in a draft or input state, and the search query \"New Star Restaurant\" has not been fully entered or executed. The app is still waiting for the user to complete the input or confirm the search. The potential reason for this failure could be: 1. The search query was not fully entered or submitted. 2. The action to confirm the search (e.g., pressing \"Enter\" or tapping a search button) was not performed.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 298, 'y': 307, 'text': 'New Star Restaurant'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"New Star Restaurant,\" and press Enter to execute the search for recent posts about the restaurant's signature dishes on X. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The text input field shows \"New StNew S\" instead of the intended \"New Star Restaurant.\" This indicates that the text was not entered correctly, likely due to a typing error or an issue with the input method. The search was not executed, as there is no indication of a search result or any change in the interface.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to open Google Maps and search for a Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 161, 'y': 1085}} | Description: This action will tap on the Google Maps app icon to open it, allowing me to proceed with the search for a Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport. | Outcome: Successful\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars. Known for flavorful rice and top-notch noodles.  - **Duck Duck Goat**: Rated 4.7 stars. Described as a hip spot for elevated Chinese cuisine.  - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1 stars. A counter-serve chain specializing in build-your-own stir-fries and other classic Chinese dishes.  Next step: Check for recent posts about the signature dishes of \"New Star Restaurant\" or \"Duck Duck Goat\" on X.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars. Known for flavorful rice and top-notch noodles.  - **Duck Duck Goat**: Rated 4.7 stars. Described as a hip spot for elevated Chinese cuisine.  - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1 stars. A counter-serve chain specializing in build-your-own stir-fries and other classic Chinese dishes.  Next step: Check for recent posts about the signature dishes of \"New Star Restaurant\" or \"Duck Duck Goat\" on X.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

A counter-serve chain specializing in build-your-own stir-fries and other classic Chinese dishes.  Next step: Check for recent posts about the signature dishes of \"New Star Restaurant\" or \"Duck Duck Goat\" on X.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars. Known for flavorful rice and top-notch noodles.  - **Duck Duck Goat**: Rated 4.7 stars. Described as a hip spot for elevated Chinese cuisine.  - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1 stars.

Next step: Check for recent posts about the signature dishes of \"New Star Restaurant\" or \"Duck Duck Goat\" on X.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Consider the following:\n(1) Are there any sequences of actions that occurred repeatedly and can be consolidated into new \"shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions.\n(2) Are there any general tips that might be useful for handling future tasks, such as advice on preventing certain common errors?\n\nProvide your output in the following format containing two parts:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar atomic action sequences are not included.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n### Updated Tips ###\nIf you have any important new tips to add (not already included in the existing tips), combine them with the current list. If there are no new tips, simply copy the existing tips here. Keep your tips concise and general. IMPORTANT: DO NOT create shortcut names that do not exist. Add new tips only if they are essential for future interactions.\n",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search_With_Enter(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, tap the search bar, type the search text, and press Enter to execute the search. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search_With_Enter(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, tap the search bar, type the search text, and press Enter to execute the search. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search_With_Enter(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, tap the search bar, type the search text, and press Enter to execute the search. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search_With_Enter(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, tap the search bar, type the search text, and press Enter to execute the search. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

Next step: Check for recent posts about the signature dishes of \"New Star Restaurant\" or \"Duck Duck Goat\" on X.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search_With_Enter(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, tap the search bar, type the search text, and press Enter to execute the search. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search_With_Enter(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, tap the search bar, type the search text, and press Enter to execute the search. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search_With_Enter(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, tap the search bar, type the search text, and press Enter to execute the search. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2).

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

The screen remains on Google Maps, and there is no indication that the X app was launched or that a search for recent posts about the restaurants was initiated.\n- Attempt 4: Action: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'X'}} | Description: This action will attempt to open the X app again, allowing me to search for recent posts about the signature dishes of \"New Star Restaurant\" or \"Duck Duck Goat.\" | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action to open the X app did not result in any visible changes on the screen. The screenshots before and after the action are identical, indicating that the app was not successfully opened or the action did not execute as intended. This could be due to the app not being launched properly or a system issue preventing the action.\n- Attempt 5: Action: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, enabling me to attempt reopening the X app from the home screen. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 6: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 414, 'y': 1740}} | Description: This action will tap on the X app icon to open it, allowing me to proceed with searching for recent posts about the signature dishes of the selected restaurants. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 7: Action: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 258, 'y': 309, 'text': 'New Star Restaurant'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the X app, type \"New Star Restaurant,\" and press Enter to search for recent posts about the restaurant's signature dishes. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The action attempted to search for \"New Star Restaurant\" on X, but instead of displaying search results, the app opened a text input field for creating a new post. This indicates that the search bar was not correctly identified or tapped, and the app misinterpreted the action as an attempt to compose a new post.\n- Attempt 8: Action: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will navigate back to the main screen of the X app, where the search bar should be visible. From there, I can attempt to search for \"New Star Restaurant\" again. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 9: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 268, 'y': 2123}} | Description: This action will tap the search icon at the bottom of the screen, which should open the search interface in the X app, allowing me to search for posts about the selected restaurants. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 10: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 268, 'y': 2125}} | Description: This action will tap the search icon at the bottom of the screen, opening the search interface in the X app. This will allow me to search for posts about \"New Star Restaurant.\" | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: None.\n- Attempt 11: Action: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 332, 'y': 159, 'text': 'New Star Restaurant'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"New Star Restaurant,\" and press Enter to search for recent posts about the restaurant's signature dishes on X. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The search for \"New Star Restaurant\" on X did not yield relevant results about the restaurant or its signature dishes.

This approach bypasses the issue with the X app. | Outcome: Failed | Error Description: The search query \"New Star Restaurant signature dishes site:x.com\" was entered, but the results do not provide relevant information about the restaurant's signature dishes. Instead, the page shows unrelated or insufficient results, indicating that the search did not yield the expected outcome.\n- Attempt 29: Action: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 325, 'y': 636, 'text': 'Duck Duck Goat signature dishes'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Duck Duck Goat signature dishes,\" and press Enter to execute the search.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

No new information was found in the screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search_With_Enter(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, tap the search bar, type the search text, and press Enter to execute the search. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

No new information was found in the screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search_With_Enter(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, tap the search bar, type the search text, and press Enter to execute the search. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search_With_Enter(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, tap the search bar, type the search text, and press Enter to execute the search. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search_With_Enter(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, tap the search bar, type the search text, and press Enter to execute the search. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Consider the following:\n(1) Are there any sequences of actions that occurred repeatedly and can be consolidated into new \"shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions.\n(2) Are there any general tips that might be useful for handling future tasks, such as advice on preventing certain common errors?\n\nProvide your output in the following format containing two parts:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar atomic action sequences are not included.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n### Updated Tips ###\nIf you have any important new tips to add (not already included in the existing tips), combine them with the current list. If there are no new tips, simply copy the existing tips here. Keep your tips concise and general. IMPORTANT: DO NOT create shortcut names that do not exist. Add new tips only if they are essential for future interactions.\n",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.  11. If an app's search bar does not respond to the Enter key, try tapping a visible \"Search\" button or confirming the query in another way.  12. If an app repeatedly fails to execute a search, consider using a web browser with a site-specific search query (e.g., \"site:x.com\") to gather relevant information.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search_With_Enter(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, tap the search bar, type the search text, and press Enter to execute the search. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_App_And_Execute_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, tap the search bar, type the search text, and press Enter to execute the search. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.  11. If an app's search bar does not respond to the Enter key, try tapping a visible \"Search\" button or confirming the query in another way.  12. If an app repeatedly fails to execute a search, consider using a web browser with a site-specific search query (e.g., \"site:x.com\") to gather relevant information.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If an app does not open successfully, return to the home screen and manually tap the app icon to reopen it.  5. When using a search interface in an app, ensure that the correct search icon or bar is tapped to avoid unintended actions, such as opening a post creation screen.  6. If a search query fails to execute correctly, ensure that the text is fully entered and the Enter key or search button is pressed to confirm the search.  7. When reopening an app to perform a search, always navigate to the search interface first before entering the query.  8. If a search query repeatedly fails to execute in an app, consider switching to a web browser or alternative app to bypass the issue.  9. When typing text in an input field, ensure that the input is complete and accurate before pressing Enter to avoid errors.  10. If an app's search interface behaves unpredictably, try navigating back to the main screen and reopening the search interface before retrying.  11. If an app's search bar does not respond to the Enter key, try tapping a visible \"Search\" button or confirming the query in another way.  12. If an app repeatedly fails to execute a search, consider using a web browser with a site-specific search query (e.g., \"site:x.com\") to gather relevant information.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **New Star Restaurant**: Rated 4.5 stars.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Reopen_And_Select_Sort_Option(dropdown_x, dropdown_y, option_x, option_y): Reopen a dropdown menu at position (dropdown_x, dropdown_y) and select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A dropdown menu is present on the screen, and the desired option is visible after reopening the menu.\n- Access_Menu_Option(menu_button_x, menu_button_y, option_x, option_y): Tap a menu button at position (menu_button_x, menu_button_y) and then select an option at position (option_x, option_y). | Precondition: A menu button is visible on the screen, and the desired option is accessible after tapping the menu button.\n- Swipe_To_Review_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to review additional content, such as menus or reviews, when the current screen does not display all relevant information. | Precondition: The current screen contains scrollable content, and additional information is expected to be revealed by swiping.\n- Swipe_And_Tap(x1, y1, x2, y2, tap_x, tap_y): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) and then tap at position (tap_x, tap_y). Useful for navigating to hidden elements that require scrolling before tapping. | Precondition: The desired element is not visible on the screen and requires swiping to reveal it before tapping.\n- Search_And_Call(search_x, search_y, search_text, call_x, call_y): Search for a specific term by tapping the search bar, typing the text, pressing Enter, and then tapping the 'Call' button to retrieve a phone number. | Precondition: The app has a visible search bar at position (search_x, search_y), and a 'Call' button is present after the search results are displayed.\n- Locate_And_Open_App(app_name, show_more_x, show_more_y, app_icon_x, app_icon_y): Locate and open an app by tapping the 'Show more' button to reveal additional apps and then selecting the app icon. | Precondition: The desired app is not visible on the current screen, and a 'Show more' button is available to reveal additional apps.\n- Reopen_App_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app from the home screen, navigate to the search interface, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, and perform a search for the specified text. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_And_Search_With_Enter(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, tap the search bar, type the search text, and press Enter to execute the search. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n- Reopen_App_And_Execute_Search(app_name, search_icon_x, search_icon_y, search_bar_x, search_bar_y, search_text): Reopen an app, navigate to the search interface by tapping the search icon, tap the search bar, type the search text, and press Enter to execute the search. | Precondition: The app is accessible from the home screen, and the search interface can be reached by tapping a search icon and then a search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",
