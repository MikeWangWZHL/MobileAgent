You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. If you want to type new text in a search box that already contains text you previously entered, make sure to clear it first by tapping the 'X' button. 3. When creating a new note, ensure the app is fully loaded before tapping the \"Add\" button to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Open_App_And_Create_Note(app_name, add_button_x, add_button_y, input_area_x, input_area_y, text): Open the specified app, tap the button to create a new note, and type the provided text into the note. | Precondition: The app is visible on the home or app screen, and the app has a button to create a new note and an input area for typing.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

By default, no APPs are opened in the background. 2. If you want to type new text in a search box that already contains text you previously entered, make sure to clear it first by tapping the 'X' button. 3. When creating a new note, ensure the app is fully loaded before tapping the \"Add\" button to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **Weather for Saturday, December 7 (Champaign, IL 61820):**   - **Temperature:** 43\u00b0F (Partly cloudy)   - **Precipitation:** 0%   - **Humidity:** 72%   - **Wind:** 16 mph   - **Hourly Forecast:**    - 7 AM: 22\u00b0F (Clear)    - 8 AM: 24\u00b0F (Clear)    - 9 AM: 29\u00b0F (Sunny)    - 10 AM: 33\u00b0F (Sunny)    - 11 AM: 37\u00b0F (Partly cloudy)    - 12 PM: 40\u00b0F (Partly cloudy)    - 1 PM: 42\u00b0F (Partly cloudy)  No new information to add.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Open_App_And_Create_Note(app_name, add_button_x, add_button_y, input_area_x, input_area_y, text): Open the specified app, tap the button to create a new note, and type the provided text into the note. | Precondition: The app is visible on the home or app screen, and the app has a button to create a new note and an input area for typing.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Open_App_And_Create_Note(app_name, add_button_x, add_button_y, input_area_x, input_area_y, text): Open the specified app, tap the button to create a new note, and type the provided text into the note. | Precondition: The app is visible on the home or app screen, and the app has a button to create a new note and an input area for typing.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future.\nFollow the following example to format the shortcut: \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n### Updated Tips ###\nIf you have any important new tips to add (not already included in the existing tips), combine them with the current list.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. If you want to type new text in a search box that already contains text you previously entered, make sure to clear it first by tapping the 'X' button.  3. When creating a new note, ensure the app is fully loaded before tapping the \"Add\" button to avoid errors.  4. Always return to the home screen before opening a new app to avoid confusion or errors when switching between apps.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **Weather for Saturday, December 7 (Champaign, IL 61820):**   - **Temperature:** 43\u00b0F (Partly cloudy)   - **Precipitation:** 0%   - **Humidity:** 72%   - **Wind:** 16 mph   - **Hourly Forecast:**    - 7 AM: 22\u00b0F (Clear)    - 8 AM: 24\u00b0F (Clear)    - 9 AM: 29\u00b0F (Sunny)    - 10 AM: 33\u00b0F (Sunny)    - 11 AM: 37\u00b0F (Partly cloudy)    - 12 PM: 40\u00b0F (Partly cloudy)    - 1 PM: 42\u00b0F (Partly cloudy)   - **Dressing Suggestions:**    - **Morning (22\u00b0F - 33\u00b0F):** Wear a heavy coat, scarf, gloves, and a hat.    - **Afternoon (37\u00b0F - 43\u00b0F):** Layered clothing with a sweater and a medium-weight jacket.    - **Evening:** Similar to morning attire as temperatures drop.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key.\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Open_App_And_Create_Note(app_name, add_button_x, add_button_y, input_area_x, input_area_y, text): Open the specified app, tap the button to create a new note, and type the provided text into the note. | Precondition: The app is visible on the home or app screen, and the app has a button to create a new note and an input area for typing.\n- Open_App_And_Add_Note(app_name, add_button_x, add_button_y): Open the specified app and tap the button to create a new note. | Precondition: The app is visible on the home or app screen, and the app has a button to create a new note.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Always return to the home screen before opening a new app to avoid confusion or errors when switching between apps.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **Weather for Saturday, December 7 (Champaign, IL 61820):**   - **Temperature:** 43\u00b0F (Partly cloudy)   - **Precipitation:** 0%   - **Humidity:** 72%   - **Wind:** 16 mph   - **Hourly Forecast:**    - 7 AM: 22\u00b0F (Clear)    - 8 AM: 24\u00b0F (Clear)    - 9 AM: 29\u00b0F (Sunny)    - 10 AM: 33\u00b0F (Sunny)    - 11 AM: 37\u00b0F (Partly cloudy)    - 12 PM: 40\u00b0F (Partly cloudy)    - 1 PM: 42\u00b0F (Partly cloudy)   - **Dressing Suggestions:**    - **Morning (22\u00b0F - 33\u00b0F):** Wear a heavy coat, scarf, gloves, and a hat.    - **Afternoon (37\u00b0F - 43\u00b0F):** Layered clothing with a sweater and a medium-weight jacket.    - **Evening:** Similar to morning attire as temperatures drop.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages). | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen.\n- Open_App_And_Create_Note(app_name, add_button_x, add_button_y, input_area_x, input_area_y, text): Open the specified app, tap the button to create a new note, and type the provided text into the note. | Precondition: The app is visible on the home or app screen, and the app has a button to create a new note and an input area for typing.\n- Open_App_And_Add_Note(app_name, add_button_x, add_button_y): Open the specified app and tap the button to create a new note. | Precondition: The app is visible on the home or app screen, and the app has a button to create a new note.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nA detailed explanation of your rationale for the action you choose.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",
