1. If you want to tap an icon of an app, use the action "Open_App".  2. If you want to exit an app, use the action "Home".  3. When searching for information or performing a query in an app, use the "Tap_Type_and_Enter" shortcut if a text input box is present. This consolidates tapping, typing, and submitting into a single action, improving efficiency.  4. When performing a search in an app, ensure that the search query is specific enough to minimize irrelevant results. This can save time when reviewing the results.  5. If multiple steps are required to gather information (e.g., comparing details of two restaurants), plan the sequence of actions carefully to avoid unnecessary app switching or redundant searches.  6. When reviewing search results in an app, prioritize tapping on entries that are most likely to meet the task's criteria based on visible information (e.g., ratings, distance, or hours). This can reduce the need to open and review multiple entries unnecessarily.  7. When dismissing pop-ups or prompts (e.g., notifications), ensure that the action is necessary and does not disrupt the flow of the task. If such prompts are common, consider preemptively identifying their dismissal buttons to streamline the process.  8. If a pop-up or prompt frequently appears during a task and is followed by a scrolling action, consider using a combined shortcut to dismiss the prompt and scroll in one sequence. This can save time and improve task flow.  9. When swiping to reveal more content, ensure that the swipe distance is sufficient to uncover the necessary information without requiring repeated swipes. This can improve efficiency and reduce redundant actions.  10. When comparing multiple entries (e.g., restaurants, products), take note of key differentiators (e.g., ratings, hours, or reviews) visible in the search results to minimize the need for opening and reviewing each entry in detail.  11. Before performing a swipe action to reveal more content, confirm that the current screen is displaying the correct context or entry. If the screen is showing a different entry or context, take corrective actions (e.g., navigating back or reselecting the desired entry) before proceeding with the swipe. This can prevent wasted actions and errors.  12. If a swipe action fails to reveal new content, verify whether the screen is displaying the correct context or entry. If not, navigate back or reselect the desired entry before retrying the swipe. This can prevent repeated errors and wasted actions.  13. When dismissing a pop-up or prompt and scrolling immediately afterward, consider using a combined shortcut (e.g., "Dismiss_And_Scroll") to streamline the process and save time.  14. If a tap action results in opening the wrong entry or unintended content, use the "Navigate_Back_And_Reselect" shortcut to quickly return to the previous screen and reselect the correct entry. This can save time and prevent repeated errors.  15. When tapping on an entry in a list, ensure that the tap position is precise and aligned with the desired entry. Misaligned taps can lead to unintended content being opened, requiring corrective actions.  16. If repeated misaligned taps occur when selecting an entry, consider adjusting the tap coordinates slightly or zooming in on the screen (if possible) to improve precision. This can help avoid errors caused by small tap targets.  17. When comparing entries with similar names or details, double-check the visible information (e.g., address, ratings) before tapping to ensure the correct entry is selected. This can prevent errors caused by selecting the wrong entry.
