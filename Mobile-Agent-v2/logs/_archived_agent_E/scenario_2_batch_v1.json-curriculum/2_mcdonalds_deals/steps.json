You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open. - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar. - The \"PickLocation & Order\" button is visible on the home screen. - The user has 4896 points in their account.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  Proceed to confirm if the Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal and add it to the mobile order.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.  - Eligible products for the deal include:   - Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Deluxe McCrispy\u2122   - McCrispy\u2122\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.  - Eligible products for the deal include:   - Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Deluxe McCrispy\u2122   - McCrispy\u2122\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.  - Eligible products for the deal include:   - Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Deluxe McCrispy\u2122   - McCrispy\u2122  - The \"Choose how to use your deal\" section is visible, with the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button available.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.  - Eligible products for the deal include:   - Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Deluxe McCrispy\u2122   - McCrispy\u2122  - The \"Choose how to use your deal\" section is visible, with the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button available.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible: Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded: Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here.

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better perceive the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[97, 43]; text: 9:18\n[181, 261]; text: Deal\n[510, 380]; text: 40% off a McCrispYTM\n[434, 498]; text: Spicy McCrispyTM,\n[609, 610]; text: McCrispyTM\n[215, 610]; text: Deluxe\n[377, 726]; text: or Deluxe Spicy\n[514, 834]; text: McCrispyTM (excludes\n[134, 954]; text: tax)\n[384, 1163]; text: All eligible products\n[279, 1285]; text: Deluxe Spicy McCrispytm\n[215, 1398]; text: Spicy McCrispyTM\n[226, 1510]; text: Deluxe McCrispyTM\n[163, 1625]; text: McCrispyTM\n[538, 2109]; text: Close\n[542, 2268]; text: O\n[542, 2267]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black border, and has two small dots inside representing app launchers on a smartphone home screen.\n[540, 2109]; icon: The Close button on the phone screen has a white outline with red fill, enclosed within a square.\n[76, 971]; icon: The icon is shaped like a square with rounded corners, filled with red diagonal lines on a white background.\n[67, 145]; icon: The icon is shaped like an \"X\" and is colored white with a red outline, indicating a closed or deleted function on a phone application.\n[846, 2266]; icon: The arrow icon on the left side of the screen points to the left, indicating navigation or movement backward.\n[239, 2266]; icon: The icon has three vertical lines, each with a slight angle at the top, and they are all solid black against a white background.\n[181, 263]; icon: The icon is a circle with the word \"Deal\" written in all capital letters, and it appears to be white or light-colored against a dark background.\n[136, 955]; icon: The icon is a black \"x\" mark on a white background, with the word \"tax\" overlaid in gray text.\n[383, 1165]; icon: The icon is a black rectangle with white text that says \"All eligible products\".\n[87, 266]; icon: The icon is shaped like a square with rounded corners, and it has a blue background with white text that reads \"tag\".\n[260, 44]; icon: The icon on the phone screen has a white background with a blue circle in the center, containing two white lines that form an \"X\" pattern.\n\nNote that this information might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.  - Eligible products for the deal include:   - Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Deluxe McCrispy\u2122   - McCrispy\u2122  - The \"Choose how to use your deal\" section is visible, with the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button available.  - The \"All eligible products\" list confirms the Spicy McCrispy\u2122 as an eligible item for the deal.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.  - Eligible products for the deal include:   - Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Deluxe McCrispy\u2122   - McCrispy\u2122  - The \"Choose how to use your deal\" section is visible, with the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button available.  - The \"All eligible products\" list confirms the Spicy McCrispy\u2122 as an eligible item for the deal.  - The deal terms and participating restaurants can be viewed via links.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.  - Eligible products for the deal include:   - Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Deluxe McCrispy\u2122   - McCrispy\u2122  - The \"Choose how to use your deal\" section is visible, with the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button available.  - The \"All eligible products\" list confirms the Spicy McCrispy\u2122 as an eligible item for the deal.  - The deal terms and participating restaurants can be viewed via links.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.  - Eligible products for the deal include:   - Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Deluxe McCrispy\u2122   - McCrispy\u2122  - The \"Choose how to use your deal\" section is visible, with the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button available.  - The \"All eligible products\" list confirms the Spicy McCrispy\u2122 as an eligible item for the deal.  - The deal terms and participating restaurants can be viewed via links.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.  - Eligible products for the deal include:   - Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Deluxe McCrispy\u2122   - McCrispy\u2122  - The \"Choose how to use your deal\" section is visible, with the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button available.  - The \"All eligible products\" list confirms the Spicy McCrispy\u2122 as an eligible item for the deal.  - The deal terms and participating restaurants can be viewed via links.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.  - Eligible products for the deal include:   - Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Deluxe McCrispy\u2122   - McCrispy\u2122  - The \"Choose how to use your deal\" section is visible, with the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button available.  - The \"All eligible products\" list confirms the Spicy McCrispy\u2122 as an eligible item for the deal.  - The deal terms and participating restaurants can be viewed via links.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state.

If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.  - Eligible products for the deal include:   - Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Deluxe McCrispy\u2122   - McCrispy\u2122  - The \"Choose how to use your deal\" section is visible, with the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button available.  - The \"All eligible products\" list confirms the Spicy McCrispy\u2122 as an eligible item for the deal.  - The deal terms and participating restaurants can be viewed via links.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.  - Eligible products for the deal include:   - Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Deluxe McCrispy\u2122   - McCrispy\u2122  - The \"Choose how to use your deal\" section is visible, with the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button available.  - The \"All eligible products\" list confirms the Spicy McCrispy\u2122 as an eligible item for the deal.  - The deal terms and participating restaurants can be viewed via links.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}.

If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.  - Eligible products for the deal include:   - Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Deluxe McCrispy\u2122   - McCrispy\u2122  - The \"Choose how to use your deal\" section is visible, with the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button available.  - The \"All eligible products\" list confirms the Spicy McCrispy\u2122 as an eligible item for the deal.  - The deal terms and participating restaurants can be viewed via links.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen.

Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. If a task requires scrolling to locate content, use a maximum number of swipes to avoid infinite loops.  5. When swiping repeatedly to load more results, ensure that the swipes are spaced out to allow the app to load content properly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Pick Location & Order\" button is visible on the home screen.  - The user has 4896 points in their account.  - The current pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\"  - There is a \"Change location\" option available.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating it may be part of a deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - The Spicy McCrispy sandwich is part of a deal offering 40% off.  - The deal applies to McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).  - The deal is valid once per day and expires on 12/29/2024.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" option is visible for using the deal.  - Eligible products for the deal include:   - Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Spicy McCrispy\u2122   - Deluxe McCrispy\u2122   - McCrispy\u2122  - The \"Choose how to use your deal\" section is visible, with the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button available.  - The \"All eligible products\" list confirms the Spicy McCrispy\u2122 as an eligible item for the deal.  - The deal terms and participating restaurants can be viewed via links.  - The deal is not available during breakfast hours or after midnight.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_Until_Visible(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until the desired content is visible or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n- Swipe_Until_Results_Loaded(x1, y1, x2, y2, max_swipes): Swipe repeatedly from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) until more results are loaded or the maximum number of swipes (max_swipes) is reached. | Precondition: The content to be revealed is below the current screen, and swiping in the specified direction will bring it into view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Use shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",
