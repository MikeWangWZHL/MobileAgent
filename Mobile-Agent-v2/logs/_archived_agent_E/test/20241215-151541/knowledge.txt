0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always verify the mode of transportation (e.g., driving, walking, public transit) after selecting directions, as the app may default to an unintended mode.  5. If the app displays unexpected results (e.g., walking time instead of driving time), check for a mode-switching option (e.g., icons for car, walking, etc.) and adjust accordingly.  6. After switching the mode of transportation, confirm that the displayed travel time updates correctly to avoid relying on outdated or incorrect information.
