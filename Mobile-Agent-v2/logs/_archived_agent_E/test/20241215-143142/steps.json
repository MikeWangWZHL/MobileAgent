If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[95, 43]; text: 2:33\n[537, 146]; text: MyM\n[921, 145]; text: 4896 pts\n[225, 319]; text: McRib is\n[158, 401]; text: back\n[325, 466]; text: It's a holiday miracle & limited*\n[782, 643]; text: Play Gift Exchange\n[296, 642]; text: Get a McRib Now\n[348, 774]; text: At participating McDonald's for a limited time.\n[485, 915]; text: More points, more free food\n[943, 965]; text: >\n[541, 967]; text: Unlock bonus offers & earn more on\n[362, 1018]; text: your next order\n[156, 1192]; text: Menu\n[899, 1192]; text: Full menu \u2192\n[240, 1788]; text: Limited Time: McRib\n[1036, 1793]; text: Happ\n[709, 1788]; text: Sandwiches & Meals\n[901, 1907]; text: 1\n[946, 1958]; text: M\n[211, 1973]; text: Checkout Now >\n[106, 2103]; text: m\n[756, 2084]; text: 0\u53e3\n[753, 2137]; text: ok\nEarn Points\n[322, 2165]; text: Order\n[106, 2166]; text: Home\n[969, 2166]; text: more\n[537, 2166]; text: Rewards & Deals\n[285, 1581]; icon: This is an icon.\n[938, 1942]; icon: The icon is shaped like a brown paper bag with a yellow handle, containing a white arch that resembles McDonald's logo, colored red and placed on top of it.\n[856, 404]; icon: This is an icon.\n[1048, 1519]; icon: The icon is shaped like a box with rounded corners, colored red on top and yellow at the bottom.\n[323, 2102]; icon: This is an icon.\n[879, 288]; icon: This is an icon.\n[539, 2107]; icon: The icon is shaped like a golden arch, with two curved lines forming an upside-down letter \"M\".

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new important notes to record. The existing important notes remain unchanged: - The McDonald's app has been successfully opened. - The next step is to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will open the McDonald's app, allowing us to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[104, 40]; text: 2:34(\n[262, 41]; text: O\n[184, 199]; text: mym\n[852, 189]; text: 4896 pts\n[903, 329]; text: View history\n[974, 442]; text: o\n[321, 498]; text: 1500\n[538, 498]; text: 3000\n[756, 498]; text: 4500\n[973, 498]; text: 6000\n[103, 499]; text: 0\n[575, 635]; text: You're viewing what's available for pickup at 616 E\n[89, 632]; text: M\n[382, 681]; text: Green St. Change location\n[256, 824]; text: My Rewards\n[923, 821]; text: View all \u2192\n[143, 934]; text: 4500 pts\n[219, 1143]; text: McCafe\n[474, 1175]; text: m\n[828, 1356]; text: Sausage\n[1057, 1357]; text: Fil\n[204, 1359]; text: Large Frappe\n[515, 1358]; text: Large French\n[516, 1391]; text: Fries\n[829, 1391]; text: McMuffin with\n[828, 1428]; text: Egg\n[808, 1494]; text: Not available\nduring Lunch\n[155, 1619]; text: Deals\n[923, 1621]; text: View all \u2192\n[804, 1772]; text: I\n[192, 1880]; text: m\n[901, 1907]; text: 1\n[944, 1956]; text: IM\n[211, 1973]; text: Checkout Now >\n[106, 2103]; text: m\n[755, 2084]; text: 00\n[753, 2137]; text: ok\nEarn Points\n[322, 2165]; text: Order\n[106, 2166]; text: Home\n[969, 2166]; text: more\n[540, 2167]; text: Rewards & Deals\n[804, 1772]; icon: This is an icon.\n[513, 1136]; icon: The icon has the shape of fries with a red container holding them, which also contains the golden arches symbol for McDonald's.\n[825, 1128]; icon: The icon has a circle with red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet colors around it.\n[200, 1145]; icon: This is an icon.\n[533, 1843]; icon: The icon is shaped like a sandwich with bread that's yellowish-brown, meat patty that's light brown, lettuce that's green, tomato that's red, mayonnaise that's white, pickle slice that's dark green, and sauce drizzle that's orange.\n[204, 1814]; icon: This is an icon.\n[938, 1942]; icon: The icon is circular with a red border, yellow background, white number \"1\" inside the circle, and two interlocking arches that form the letter \"M\".\n[538, 2107]; icon: The logo for McDonald's, which resembles two golden arches against a red background.\n[825, 1143]; icon: This is an icon.\n[90, 638]; icon: This is an icon.\n[1040, 1125]; icon: The icon is circular with a yellow border, featuring two pieces of bread surrounding some meat and cheese.\n[323, 2102]; icon: The icon is shaped like french fries with two yellow lines on top, and it's outlined in black.\n[221, 1141]; icon: The icon has rounded corners, making it appear like a square with curved edges; its colors include white text on a light yellow background.\n[898, 1906]; icon: The number \"1\" is displayed in white against a black background, surrounded by a thin blue border with rounded corners.\n[696, 1477]; icon: This is an icon.\n[190, 203]; icon: The logo for MyM, which appears as two interlocking yellow M's with red text that reads \"My\" to their left.\n[543, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black border, and has two small dots inside representing app launchers on a smartphone home screen.\n[488, 1141]; icon: The icon is shaped like a red paper fry container with McDonald's logo on it, filled to the brim with golden french fries.\n[451, 439]; icon: The icon is a horizontal line with dots on it, colored in orange to red gradient.\n[851, 190]; icon: The icon is a black rectangle with white text that says \"4896 pts\".\n[150, 1264]; icon: The icon is square-shaped with rounded corners, featuring shades of brown to represent caramel candies or nuts.\n[156, 1620]; icon: The icon is a black capital letter \"D\" with a white outline, giving it a simple yet distinctive appearance.\n[835, 1889]; icon: The icon is a square with rounded corners, filled with orange-brown color.\n[811, 440]; icon: The icon is circular, white with orange border, and has two intersecting half-circles inside.\n[107, 2103]; icon: The icon is shaped like a golden arch with a white background, representing McDonald's logo.\n[210, 1848]; icon: This is an icon.\n[531, 1802]; icon: The icon shows a sandwich with two pickles on it, all set against a white background.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app has been successfully opened. - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is currently being viewed. - The pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\" with an option to change the location. - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of a Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating a potential deal related to it. Further action is required to confirm and add it to the mobile order.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will open the McDonald's app, allowing us to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 537, 'y': 2166}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Rewards & Deals\" button in the bottom navigation bar, navigating to the section where deals and rewards can be reviewed. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app has been successfully opened.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is currently being viewed.  - The pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\" with an option to change the location.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of a Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating a potential deal related to it.  - A deal offering **40% off a McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122** (excluding tax) is available.   - Valid once per day.   - Expires on **12/29/2024**.   - Not available during breakfast or after midnight.  - The deal can be added to the mobile order.  Next step: Add the deal to the mobile order.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will open the McDonald's app, allowing us to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 537, 'y': 2166}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Rewards & Deals\" button in the bottom navigation bar, navigating to the section where deals and rewards can be reviewed. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 1800}} | Description: This action will tap on the Spicy McCrispy deal in the \"Deals\" section to view its details and proceed with adding it to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app has been successfully opened.  - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is currently being viewed.  - The pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\" with an option to change the location.  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of a Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating a potential deal related to it.  - A deal offering **40% off a McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122** (excluding tax) is available.   - Valid once per day.   - Expires on **12/29/2024**.   - Not available during breakfast or after midnight.  - The deal can be added to the mobile order.  Next step: Add the deal to the mobile order.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will open the McDonald's app, allowing us to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 537, 'y': 2166}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Rewards & Deals\" button in the bottom navigation bar, navigating to the section where deals and rewards can be reviewed. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 1800}} | Description: This action will tap on the Spicy McCrispy deal in the \"Deals\" section to view its details and proceed with adding it to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 1800}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. This will proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is identical to the screen before the action. The \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was tapped, but it did not result in any visible change or progression to the next step in the ordering process. This could be due to a failure in registering the tap or an issue with the app.\n\nPRO TIP: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes, consider using a Swipe action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",
