Our approach streamlines the\ndetection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand\n[476, 1720]; text: designed components like a non-maximum suppression\n[535, 1949]; text: procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior\nknowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the new\nframework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-\nbased global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite\nmatching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture.\nGiven a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons\nabout the relations of the objects and the global image context\nto directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new\nmodel is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized\n[425, 2174]; text: library, unlike many other modern detectors.DETR\n[240, 2266]; text: III\n[876, 157]; icon: The icon is square-shaped with rounded corners, filled with white color and has a black outline.\n[67, 158]; icon: The icon is shaped like a house with a white outline and a light gray fill.\n[736, 157]; icon: The icon is a white plus sign with rounded edges, set against a black background.\n[77, 315]; icon: The icon is shaped like an arrow pointing to the left, with black lines outlining its path on a white background.\n[923, 42]; icon: The icon is a white circle with two black lines forming an \"X\" shape, representing the Wi-Fi symbol.\n[400, 156]; icon: The icon is oval-shaped with black background, white text that says \"scholar.google.com/\" and two small dots on either side of the text.\n[541, 2267]; icon: This is an icon.\n[164, 44]; icon: The icon is a white circle with a black outline, commonly known as a \"minus\" symbol.\n[961, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[97, 44]; icon: This is an icon.\n[1008, 43]; icon: The battery icon is rectangular with rounded corners, filled with white lines to represent different levels of charge, and has a green background.\n[1010, 156]; icon: The icon is circular with three vertical dots in the center, all in black on a white background.\n[970, 44]; icon: The icon is a white signal bar with three solid black lines, indicating full reception or connectivity on a mobile device.\nPlease note that this information is not necessarily accurate. You need to combine the screenshot to understand.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nWe extract the keyboard status of the current screenshot and it is whether the keyboard of the current screenshot is activated.\nThe keyboard status is as follow:\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Hint ###\nThere are hints to help you complete the user's instructions. The hints are as follow:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### History operations ###\nBefore reaching this page, some operations have been completed. You need to refer to the completed operations to decide the next operation. These operations are as follow:\nStep-1: [Operation: Opening the Chrome app; Action: Open_App(Chrome)]\n\n### Progress ###\nAfter completing the history operations, you have the following thoughts about the progress of user's instruction completion:\nCompleted contents:\nOpened the Chrome app on the mobile phone.\n\n### Response requirements ###\nNow you need to combine all of the above to perform just one action on the current page. You must choose one of the six actions below:\nOpen_App (app name): If the current page is desktop, you can use this action to open the app named \"app name\" on the desktop.\nTap (x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current page.\nSwipe (x1, y1), (x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2).\nUnable to Type. You cannot use the actions involving \"Type\" because the keyboard has not been activated. If you want to type, please first activate the keyboard by tapping on the input box on the screen.\nEnter: Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App: Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack: Return to the previous state.\nHome: Return to home page.\nWait: Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nStop: If you think all the requirements of user's instruction have been completed and no further operation is required, you can choose this action to terminate the operation process.\n\n### Output format ###\nYour output consists of the following three parts:\n### Thought ###\nThink step by step: check what has been completed and what still needs to be done. Before deciding to stop, put yourself in the user's shoes to ensure satisfaction with the current status. Make sure you have explored sufficiently if the situation implies further investigation.\n### Action ###\nYou can only choose one from the six actions above. Make sure that the coordinates or text in the \"()\".\n### Operation ###\nPlease generate a brief natural language description for the operation in Action based on your Thought.",
