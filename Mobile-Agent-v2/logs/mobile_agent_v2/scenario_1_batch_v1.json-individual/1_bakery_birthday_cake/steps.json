Before deciding to stop, put yourself in the user's shoes to ensure satisfaction with the current status. Make sure you have explored sufficiently if the situation implies further investigation.\n### Action ###\nYou can only choose one from the six actions above.

You need to combine the screenshot to understand.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nWe extract the keyboard status of the current screenshot and it is whether the keyboard of the current screenshot is activated.\nThe keyboard status is as follow:\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Hint ###\nThere are hints to help you complete the user's instructions. The hints are as follow:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### History operations ###\nBefore reaching this page, some operations have been completed. You need to refer to the completed operations to decide the next operation. These operations are as follow:\nStep-1: [Operation: Opening the Google Maps app; Action: Open_App (Maps)]\nStep-2: [Operation: Tap on the search bar in Google Maps; Action: Tap (449, 170)]\nStep-3: [Operation: Type \"bakery near me\" into the search bar; Action: Type (\"bakery near me\")]\nStep-4: [Operation: Tap on the \"Map\" button; Action: Tap (935, 874)]\n\n### Progress ###\nAfter completing the history operations, you have the following thoughts about the progress of user's instruction completion:\nCompleted contents:\nOpened the Google Maps app, tapped on the search bar, typed \"bakery near me\" into the search bar, and tapped on the \"Map\" button.\n\n### Memory ###\nDuring the operations, you record the following contents on the screenshot for use in subsequent operations:\nMemory:\nbakery near me\n\n### Last operation ###\nYou previously wanted to perform the operation \"Tap on the bakery icon or location near the top left of the map to view more details.\" on this page and executed the Action \"Tap (145, 452)\". But you find that this operation does not meet your expectation. You need to reflect and revise your operation this time.\n\n### Response requirements ###\nNow you need to combine all of the above to perform just one action on the current page. You must choose one of the six actions below:\nOpen_App (app name): If the current page is desktop, you can use this action to open the app named \"app name\" on the desktop.\nTap (x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current page.\nSwipe (x1, y1), (x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2).\nUnable to Type. You cannot use the actions involving \"Type\" because the keyboard has not been activated. If you want to type, please first activate the keyboard by tapping on the input box on the screen.\nEnter: Press the Enter key.\nSwitch_App: Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack: Return to the previous state.\nHome: Return to home page.\nWait: Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nStop: If you think all the requirements of user's instruction have been completed and no further operation is required, you can choose this action to terminate the operation process.\n\n### Output format ###\nYour output consists of the following three parts:\n### Thought ###\nThink step by step: check what has been completed and what still needs to be done. Before deciding to stop, put yourself in the user's shoes to ensure satisfaction with the current status. Make sure you have explored sufficiently if the situation implies further investigation.\n### Action ###\nYou can only choose one from the six actions above. Make sure that the coordinates or text in the \"()\".\n### Operation ###\nPlease generate a brief natural language description for the operation in Action based on your Thought.",
