If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Tripadvisor'}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to search for highly recommended restaurants in Chicago. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **The Purple Pig**   - Highly rated restaurant in Chicago with 6,259 reviews.   - Cuisine: Mediterranean, Vegetarian options available.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.  - **Virtue Restaurant**   - Michelin-rated restaurant in Chicago with 81 reviews.   - Cuisine: American.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.  No must-try dishes identified yet. Further review of individual restaurant reviews is needed.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Tripadvisor'}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to search for highly recommended restaurants in Chicago. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 526, 'y': 386, 'text': 'restaurants in Chicago'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"restaurants in Chicago,\" and execute the search to find relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **The Purple Pig**   - Highly rated restaurant in Chicago with 6,259 reviews.   - Cuisine: Mediterranean, Vegetarian options available.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.  - **Virtue Restaurant**   - Michelin-rated restaurant in Chicago with 81 reviews.   - Cuisine: American.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.  No must-try dishes identified yet. Further review of individual restaurant reviews is needed.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Tripadvisor'}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to search for highly recommended restaurants in Chicago. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 526, 'y': 386, 'text': 'restaurants in Chicago'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"restaurants in Chicago,\" and execute the search to find relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 232, 'y': 1409}} | Description: This action will tap on \"The Purple Pig\" to open its page and access reviews to identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **The Purple Pig**   - Highly rated restaurant in Chicago with 6,259 reviews.   - Cuisine: Mediterranean, Vegetarian options available.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.   - Overall rating: 4.5/5 (based on traveler insights).   - Food rating: 4.6/5.   - Service rating: 4.4/5.   - Atmosphere rating: 4.2/5.   - Value rating: 4.1/5.   - Reviews summary highlights its inventive cuisine.  - **Virtue Restaurant**   - Michelin-rated restaurant in Chicago with 81 reviews.   - Cuisine: American.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Tripadvisor'}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to search for highly recommended restaurants in Chicago. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 526, 'y': 386, 'text': 'restaurants in Chicago'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"restaurants in Chicago,\" and execute the search to find relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 232, 'y': 1409}} | Description: This action will tap on \"The Purple Pig\" to open its page and access reviews to identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 513, 'y': 1180}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"6,259 reviews\" text to open the reviews section for \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to read customer feedback and identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **The Purple Pig**   - Highly rated restaurant in Chicago with 6,259 reviews.   - Cuisine: Mediterranean, Vegetarian options available.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.   - Overall rating: 4.5/5 (based on traveler insights).   - Food rating: 4.6/5.   - Service rating: 4.4/5.   - Atmosphere rating: 4.2/5.   - Value rating: 4.1/5.   - Reviews summary highlights its inventive and tasty menu, despite occasional inconsistency.   - Location is described as both convenient and inconspicuous.   - Atmosphere: Vibrant and communal.   - Food: Flavorful.   - Service: Knowledgeable.   - Value: Reasonable.  - **Virtue Restaurant**   - Michelin-rated restaurant in Chicago with 81 reviews.   - Cuisine: American.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Tripadvisor'}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to search for highly recommended restaurants in Chicago. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 526, 'y': 386, 'text': 'restaurants in Chicago'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"restaurants in Chicago,\" and execute the search to find relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 232, 'y': 1409}} | Description: This action will tap on \"The Purple Pig\" to open its page and access reviews to identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 513, 'y': 1180}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"6,259 reviews\" text to open the reviews section for \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to read customer feedback and identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more detailed reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **The Purple Pig**   - Highly rated restaurant in Chicago with 6,259 reviews.   - Cuisine: Mediterranean, Vegetarian options available.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.   - Overall rating: 4.5/5 (based on traveler insights).   - Food rating: 4.6/5.   - Service rating: 4.4/5.   - Atmosphere rating: 4.2/5.   - Value rating: 4.1/5.   - Reviews summary highlights its inventive and tasty menu, despite occasional inconsistency.   - Location is described as both convenient and inconspicuous.   - Atmosphere: Vibrant and communal.   - Food: Flavorful.   - Service: Knowledgeable.   - Value: Reasonable.  - **Virtue Restaurant**   - Michelin-rated restaurant in Chicago with 81 reviews.   - Cuisine: American.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 526, 'y': 386, 'text': 'restaurants in Chicago'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"restaurants in Chicago,\" and execute the search to find relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 232, 'y': 1409}} | Description: This action will tap on \"The Purple Pig\" to open its page and access reviews to identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 513, 'y': 1180}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"6,259 reviews\" text to open the reviews section for \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to read customer feedback and identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more detailed reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more detailed reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 232, 'y': 1409}} | Description: This action will tap on \"The Purple Pig\" to open its page and access reviews to identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 513, 'y': 1180}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"6,259 reviews\" text to open the reviews section for \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to read customer feedback and identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more detailed reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more detailed reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more content, potentially including detailed reviews about must-try dishes for \"The Purple Pig.\" | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 513, 'y': 1180}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"6,259 reviews\" text to open the reviews section for \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to read customer feedback and identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more detailed reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more detailed reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more content, potentially including detailed reviews about must-try dishes for \"The Purple Pig.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more detailed reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to gather specific information about the must-try dishes mentioned. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **The Purple Pig**   - Highly rated restaurant in Chicago with 6,259 reviews.   - Cuisine: Mediterranean, Vegetarian options available.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.   - Overall rating: 4.5/5 (based on traveler insights).   - Food rating: 4.6/5.   - Service rating: 4.4/5.   - Atmosphere rating: 4.2/5.   - Value rating: 4.1/5.   - Reviews summary highlights its inventive and tasty menu, despite occasional inconsistency.   - Location is described as both convenient and inconspicuous.   - Atmosphere: Vibrant and communal.   - Food: Flavorful.   - Service: Knowledgeable.   - Value: Reasonable.   - **Must-try dishes (based on popular mentions):**    - Bone marrow    - Pork    - Pig ears    - Whipped feta    - Hummus (featured in images with chickpeas and bread).   - **Additional Review Details for The Purple Pig:**    - A reviewer from Miami, FL, described the restaurant as offering \"amazing gourmet/Mediterranean food.\"    - The flavor and originality of the dishes were highly praised.    - Recommended for visitors to Chicago.    - Photos in the review show dishes with vibrant presentation, including a hummus dish with chickpeas, a dessert with mint garnish, and a pistachio-topped dish.    - Date visited: December 2024.    - Trip type: Family.    - Another reviewer (3 weeks ago) described the restaurant as \"top of the list for Chicago eats,\" praising the food and service consistency since 2021.    - Ambiance is versatile, suitable for family nights, date nights, and girls' nights.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more detailed reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more detailed reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to identify must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more content, potentially including detailed reviews about must-try dishes for \"The Purple Pig.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more detailed reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to gather specific information about the must-try dishes mentioned. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" potentially uncovering specific mentions of must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **The Purple Pig**   - Highly rated restaurant in Chicago with 6,259 reviews.   - Cuisine: Mediterranean, Vegetarian options available.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.   - Overall rating: 4.5/5 (based on traveler insights).   - Food rating: 4.6/5.   - Service rating: 4.4/5.   - Atmosphere rating: 4.2/5.   - Value rating: 4.1/5.   - Reviews summary highlights its inventive and tasty menu, despite occasional inconsistency.   - Location is described as both convenient and inconspicuous.   - Atmosphere: Vibrant and communal.   - Food: Flavorful.   - Service: Knowledgeable.   - Value: Reasonable.   - **Must-try dishes (based on popular mentions):**    - Bone marrow    - Pork    - Pig ears    - Whipped feta    - Hummus (featured in images with chickpeas and bread).   - **Additional Review Details for The Purple Pig:**    - A reviewer from Miami, FL, described the restaurant as offering \"amazing gourmet/Mediterranean food.\"    - The flavor and originality of the dishes were highly praised.    - Recommended for visitors to Chicago.    - Photos in the review show dishes with vibrant presentation, including a hummus dish with chickpeas, a dessert with mint garnish, and a pistachio-topped dish.    - Date visited: December 2024.    - Trip type: Family.    - Another reviewer (3 weeks ago) described the restaurant as \"top of the list for Chicago eats,\" praising the food and service consistency since 2021.    - Ambiance is versatile, suitable for family nights, date nights, and girls' nights.    - A recent review (1 month ago) by Daniel R from Anaheim, CA, described the restaurant as offering \"a fantastic meal in an obscure location.\"    - Hummus is featured prominently in images, served with chickpeas and bread.    - Date visited: September 2024.    - Trip type: Couples.   - **Newly observed details:**    - A review mentions that the concierge highly recommended the restaurant, stating they would not regret visiting.    - Photos in the review show dishes with vibrant presentation, including a meat dish with greens, a fish dish with sauce, and a vegetable dish with broccoli.    - Date visited: November 2024.    - Trip type: Couples.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type.

Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more content, potentially including detailed reviews about must-try dishes for \"The Purple Pig.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more detailed reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" allowing me to gather specific information about the must-try dishes mentioned. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" potentially uncovering specific mentions of must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" potentially uncovering specific mentions of must-try dishes like bone marrow, pork, pig ears, or whipped feta. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal additional reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" potentially uncovering specific mentions of must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - **The Purple Pig**   - Highly rated restaurant in Chicago with 6,259 reviews.   - Cuisine: Mediterranean, Vegetarian options available.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.   - Overall rating: 4.5/5 (based on traveler insights).   - Food rating: 4.6/5.   - Service rating: 4.4/5.   - Atmosphere rating: 4.2/5.   - Value rating: 4.1/5.   - Reviews summary highlights its inventive and tasty menu, despite occasional inconsistency.   - Location is described as both convenient and inconspicuous.   - Atmosphere: Vibrant and communal.   - Food: Flavorful.   - Service: Knowledgeable.   - Value: Reasonable.   - **Must-try dishes (based on popular mentions):**    - Bone marrow    - Pork    - Pig ears    - Whipped feta    - Hummus (featured in images with chickpeas and bread).   - **Additional Review Details for The Purple Pig:**    - A reviewer from Miami, FL, described the restaurant as offering \"amazing gourmet/Mediterranean food.\"    - The flavor and originality of the dishes were highly praised.    - Recommended for visitors to Chicago.    - Photos in the review show dishes with vibrant presentation, including a hummus dish with chickpeas, a dessert with mint garnish, and a pistachio-topped dish.    - Date visited: December 2024.    - Trip type: Family.    - Another reviewer (3 weeks ago) described the restaurant as \"top of the list for Chicago eats,\" praising the food and service consistency since 2021.    - Ambiance is versatile, suitable for family nights, date nights, and girls' nights.    - A recent review (1 month ago) by Daniel R from Anaheim, CA, described the restaurant as offering \"a fantastic meal in an obscure location.\"    - Hummus is featured prominently in images, served with chickpeas and bread.    - Date visited: September 2024.    - Trip type: Couples.   - **Newly observed details:**    - A review mentions that the concierge highly recommended the restaurant, stating they would not regret visiting.    - Photos in the review show dishes with vibrant presentation, including a meat dish with greens, a fish dish with sauce, and a vegetable dish with broccoli.    - Date visited: November 2024.    - Trip type: Couples.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - **The Purple Pig**   - Highly rated restaurant in Chicago with 6,259 reviews.   - Cuisine: Mediterranean, Vegetarian options available.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.   - Overall rating: 4.5/5 (based on traveler insights).   - Food rating: 4.6/5.   - Service rating: 4.4/5.   - Atmosphere rating: 4.2/5.   - Value rating: 4.1/5.   - Reviews summary highlights its inventive and tasty menu, despite occasional inconsistency.   - Location is described as both convenient and inconspicuous.   - Atmosphere: Vibrant and communal.   - Food: Flavorful.   - Service: Knowledgeable.   - Value: Reasonable.   - **Must-try dishes (based on popular mentions):**    - Bone marrow    - Pork    - Pig ears    - Whipped feta    - Hummus (featured in images with chickpeas and bread).   - **Additional Review Details for The Purple Pig:**    - A reviewer from Miami, FL, described the restaurant as offering \"amazing gourmet/Mediterranean food.\"    - The flavor and originality of the dishes were highly praised.    - Recommended for visitors to Chicago.    - Photos in the review show dishes with vibrant presentation, including a hummus dish with chickpeas, a dessert with mint garnish, and a pistachio-topped dish.    - Date visited: December 2024.    - Trip type: Family.    - Another reviewer (3 weeks ago) described the restaurant as \"top of the list for Chicago eats,\" praising the food and service consistency since 2021.    - Ambiance is versatile, suitable for family nights, date nights, and girls' nights.    - A recent review (1 month ago) by Daniel R from Anaheim, CA, described the restaurant as offering \"a fantastic meal in an obscure location.\"    - Hummus is featured prominently in images, served with chickpeas and bread.    - Date visited: September 2024.    - Trip type: Couples.   - **Newly observed details:**    - A review mentions that the concierge highly recommended the restaurant, stating they would not regret visiting.    - Photos in the review show dishes with vibrant presentation, including a meat dish with greens, a fish dish with sauce, and a vegetable dish with broccoli.    - Date visited: November 2024.    - Trip type: Couples.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal additional reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" potentially uncovering specific mentions of must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" potentially uncovering specific mentions of the must-try dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal additional reviews about The Purple Pig, potentially uncovering specific mentions of must-try dishes like bone marrow, pork, pig ears, or whipped feta. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal additional reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" potentially uncovering specific mentions of must-try dishes like bone marrow, pork, pig ears, or whipped feta. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and reveal more reviews about \"The Purple Pig,\" potentially uncovering specific mentions of must-try dishes like bone marrow, pork, pig ears, or whipped feta. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The swipe action did not reveal any new content on the screen. The before and after screenshots are identical, indicating that the screen did not scroll down to display additional reviews or relevant information about the must-try dishes.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The before and after screenshots are identical, indicating that the screen did not scroll down to display additional reviews or relevant information about the must-try dishes.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down and check if additional reviews or relevant information about the must-try dishes for \"The Purple Pig\" are revealed. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - **The Purple Pig**   - Highly rated restaurant in Chicago with 6,259 reviews.   - Cuisine: Mediterranean, Vegetarian options available.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.   - Overall rating: 4.5/5 (based on traveler insights).   - Food rating: 4.6/5.   - Service rating: 4.4/5.   - Atmosphere rating: 4.2/5.   - Value rating: 4.1/5.   - Reviews summary highlights its inventive and tasty menu, despite occasional inconsistency.   - Location is described as both convenient and inconspicuous.   - Atmosphere: Vibrant and communal.   - Food: Flavorful.   - Service: Knowledgeable.   - Value: Reasonable.   - **Must-try dishes (based on popular mentions):**    - Bone marrow    - Pork    - Pig ears    - Whipped feta    - Hummus (featured in images with chickpeas and bread).   - **Additional Review Details for The Purple Pig:**    - A reviewer from Miami, FL, described the restaurant as offering \"amazing gourmet/Mediterranean food.\"    - The flavor and originality of the dishes were highly praised.    - Recommended for visitors to Chicago.    - Photos in the review show dishes with vibrant presentation, including a hummus dish with chickpeas, a dessert with mint garnish, and a pistachio-topped dish.    - Date visited: December 2024.    - Trip type: Family.    - Another reviewer (3 weeks ago) described the restaurant as \"top of the list for Chicago eats,\" praising the food and service consistency since 2021.    - Ambiance is versatile, suitable for family nights, date nights, and girls' nights.    - A recent review (1 month ago) by Daniel R from Anaheim, CA, described the restaurant as offering \"a fantastic meal in an obscure location.\"    - Hummus is featured prominently in images, served with chickpeas and bread.    - Date visited: September 2024.    - Trip type: Couples.   - **Newly observed details:**    - A review mentions that the concierge highly recommended the restaurant, stating they would not regret visiting.    - Photos in the review show dishes with vibrant presentation, including a meat dish with greens, a fish dish with sauce, and a vegetable dish with broccoli.    - Date visited: November 2024.    - Trip type: Couples.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down and check if additional reviews or relevant information about the must-try dishes for \"The Purple Pig\" are revealed. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down and reveal more reviews or relevant information about the must-try dishes for \"The Purple Pig.\" This action aims to locate specific mentions of dishes like bone marrow, pork, pig ears, or whipped feta. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down and check if additional reviews or relevant information about the must-try dishes for \"The Purple Pig\" are revealed.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - **The Purple Pig**   - Highly rated restaurant in Chicago with 6,259 reviews.   - Cuisine: Mediterranean, Vegetarian options available.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.   - Overall rating: 4.5/5 (based on traveler insights).   - Food rating: 4.6/5.   - Service rating: 4.4/5.   - Atmosphere rating: 4.2/5.   - Value rating: 4.1/5.   - Reviews summary highlights its inventive and tasty menu, despite occasional inconsistency.   - Location is described as both convenient and inconspicuous.   - Atmosphere: Vibrant and communal.   - Food: Flavorful.   - Service: Knowledgeable.   - Value: Reasonable.   - **Must-try dishes (based on popular mentions):**    - Bone marrow    - Pork    - Pig ears    - Whipped feta    - Hummus (featured in images with chickpeas and bread).   - **Additional Review Details for The Purple Pig:**    - A reviewer from Miami, FL, described the restaurant as offering \"amazing gourmet/Mediterranean food.\"    - The flavor and originality of the dishes were highly praised.    - Recommended for visitors to Chicago.    - Photos in the review show dishes with vibrant presentation, including a hummus dish with chickpeas, a dessert with mint garnish, and a pistachio-topped dish.    - Date visited: December 2024.    - Trip type: Family.    - Another reviewer (3 weeks ago) described the restaurant as \"top of the list for Chicago eats,\" praising the food and service consistency since 2021.    - Ambiance is versatile, suitable for family nights, date nights, and girls' nights.    - A recent review (1 month ago) by Daniel R from Anaheim, CA, described the restaurant as offering \"a fantastic meal in an obscure location.\"    - Hummus is featured prominently in images, served with chickpeas and bread.    - Date visited: September 2024.    - Trip type: Couples.   - **Newly observed details:**    - A review mentions that the concierge highly recommended the restaurant, stating they would not regret visiting.    - Photos in the review show dishes with vibrant presentation, including a meat dish with greens, a fish dish with sauce, and a vegetable dish with broccoli.    - Date visited: November 2024.    - Trip type: Couples.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down and check if additional reviews or relevant information about the must-try dishes for \"The Purple Pig\" are revealed.

The screenshots before and after the action are identical, indicating that the screen did not scroll further down to reveal additional reviews or relevant information.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down and check if additional reviews or relevant information about the must-try dishes for \"The Purple Pig\" are revealed.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down and check if additional reviews or relevant information about the must-try dishes for \"The Purple Pig\" are revealed.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - **The Purple Pig**   - Highly rated restaurant in Chicago with 6,259 reviews.   - Cuisine: Mediterranean, Vegetarian options available.   - Price range: $$ - $$$.   - Status: Open now.   - Overall rating: 4.5/5 (based on traveler insights).   - Food rating: 4.6/5.   - Service rating: 4.4/5.   - Atmosphere rating: 4.2/5.   - Value rating: 4.1/5.   - Reviews summary highlights its inventive and tasty menu, despite occasional inconsistency.   - Location is described as both convenient and inconspicuous.   - Atmosphere: Vibrant and communal.   - Food: Flavorful.   - Service: Knowledgeable.   - Value: Reasonable.   - **Must-try dishes (based on popular mentions):**    - Bone marrow    - Pork    - Pig ears    - Whipped feta    - Hummus (featured in images with chickpeas and bread).   - **Additional Review Details for The Purple Pig:**    - A reviewer from Miami, FL, described the restaurant as offering \"amazing gourmet/Mediterranean food.\"    - The flavor and originality of the dishes were highly praised.    - Recommended for visitors to Chicago.    - Photos in the review show dishes with vibrant presentation, including a hummus dish with chickpeas, a dessert with mint garnish, and a pistachio-topped dish.    - Date visited: December 2024.    - Trip type: Family.    - Another reviewer (3 weeks ago) described the restaurant as \"top of the list for Chicago eats,\" praising the food and service consistency since 2021.    - Ambiance is versatile, suitable for family nights, date nights, and girls' nights.    - A recent review (1 month ago) by Daniel R from Anaheim, CA, described the restaurant as offering \"a fantastic meal in an obscure location.\"    - Hummus is featured prominently in images, served with chickpeas and bread.    - Date visited: September 2024.    - Trip type: Couples.   - **Newly observed details:**    - A review mentions that the concierge highly recommended the restaurant, stating they would not regret visiting.    - Photos in the review show dishes with vibrant presentation, including a meat dish with greens, a fish dish with sauce, and a vegetable dish with broccoli.    - Date visited: November 2024.    - Trip type: Couples.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down and reveal more reviews or relevant information about the must-try dishes for \"The Purple Pig.\" This action aims to locate specific mentions of dishes like bone marrow, pork, pig ears, or whipped feta. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The swipe action did not result in any new content being displayed.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Make sure that the rating is higher than 7.0. Double check on Google Maps to see if it is close to the Green Street. Show me your final choice on Booking.\n\n---\nCarefully reflect on the interaction history of the current task. Check if there are any subgoals that are accomplished by a sequence of successful actions and can be consolidated into new \"Shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions. For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Full Action History ###\n- Action: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Tripadvisor'}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to search for highly recommended restaurants in Chicago. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The Tripadvisor app has been successfully opened.

If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.  9. If scrolling through content does not reveal new information, consider alternative methods to locate the required details, such as using a search or filter function within the app.  10. If the end of a section is reached and the required information is not found, reassess the search criteria or explore other sections of the app for relevant details.  11. When searching for specific items (e.g., dishes, amenities), use keywords or filters to narrow down results and save time.  12. If repetitive actions (e.g., swiping) fail to yield results, pause and evaluate whether the task can be completed using a different approach or if the information is unavailable.",
