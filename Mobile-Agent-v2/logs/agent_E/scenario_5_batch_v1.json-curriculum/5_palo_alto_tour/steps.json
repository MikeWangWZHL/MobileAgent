If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 918, 'y': 1412}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to proceed with searching for museums in Palo Alto, CA. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The user is planning a one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA, focusing on museums and non-seafood dining options. - Museums in Palo Alto, CA, have been searched on Tripadvisor, and the following options are displayed:  1. **Cantor Arts Center** - Art Museum with 483 reviews.  2. **The Foster Museum** - Speciality Museum and Art Museum with 32 reviews.  3. **Palo Alto Junior Museum & Zoo** - Children's Museum with 68 reviews.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 918, 'y': 1412}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to proceed with searching for museums in Palo Alto, CA. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 526, 'y': 386, 'text': 'museums in Palo Alto, CA'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"museums in Palo Alto, CA,\" and execute the search to display relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 918, 'y': 1412}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to proceed with searching for museums in Palo Alto, CA. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 526, 'y': 386, 'text': 'museums in Palo Alto, CA'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"museums in Palo Alto, CA,\" and execute the search to display relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 679, 'y': 589}} | Description: This action will select the \"Cantor Arts Center\" option, the first museum on the list, to include it in the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The user is planning a one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA, focusing on museums and non-seafood dining options.  - Museums in Palo Alto, CA, have been searched on Tripadvisor, and the following options are displayed:   1. **Cantor Arts Center** - Art Museum with 483 reviews.   2. **The Foster Museum** - Speciality Museum and Art Museum with 32 reviews.   3. **Palo Alto Junior Museum & Zoo** - Children's Museum with 68 reviews.  - **Cantor Arts Center** has been successfully selected as one of the museums for the itinerary.   - **Cantor Arts Center** details:    - Rated 4.5 stars with 483 reviews.    - Ranked #2 of 68 things to do in Palo Alto.    - Category: Art Museums.    - Hours: 11:00 AM - 5:00 PM.    - Currently closed at the time of viewing.  - **The Foster Museum** has been identified as the second museum for the itinerary.   - **The Foster Museum** details:    - Rated 4.5 stars with 32 reviews.    - Category: Speciality Museums and Art Museums.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2).

For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 918, 'y': 1412}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to proceed with searching for museums in Palo Alto, CA. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 526, 'y': 386, 'text': 'museums in Palo Alto, CA'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"museums in Palo Alto, CA,\" and execute the search to display relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 679, 'y': 589}} | Description: This action will select the \"Cantor Arts Center\" option, the first museum on the list, to include it in the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 83, 'y': 159}} | Description: This action will tap the back button to return to the search results page, where I can locate and select \"The Foster Museum\" as the next museum for the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop.

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The user is planning a one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA, focusing on museums and non-seafood dining options.  - Museums in Palo Alto, CA, have been searched on Tripadvisor, and the following options are displayed:   1. **Cantor Arts Center** - Art Museum with 483 reviews.   2. **The Foster Museum** - Speciality Museum and Art Museum with 32 reviews.   3. **Palo Alto Junior Museum & Zoo** - Children's Museum with 68 reviews.  - **Cantor Arts Center** has been successfully selected as one of the museums for the itinerary.   - **Cantor Arts Center** details:    - Rated 4.5 stars with 483 reviews.    - Ranked #2 of 68 things to do in Palo Alto.    - Category: Art Museums.    - Hours: 11:00 AM - 5:00 PM.    - Currently closed at the time of viewing.  - **The Foster Museum** has been identified as the second museum for the itinerary.   - **The Foster Museum** details:    - Rated 5.0 stars with 32 reviews.    - Ranked #8 of 68 things to do in Palo Alto.    - Category: Speciality Museums and Art Museums.    - Hours: 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM.    - Currently closed at the time of viewing.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 918, 'y': 1412}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to proceed with searching for museums in Palo Alto, CA. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 526, 'y': 386, 'text': 'museums in Palo Alto, CA'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"museums in Palo Alto, CA,\" and execute the search to display relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 679, 'y': 589}} | Description: This action will select the \"Cantor Arts Center\" option, the first museum on the list, to include it in the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 83, 'y': 159}} | Description: This action will tap the back button to return to the search results page, where I can locate and select \"The Foster Museum\" as the next museum for the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 683, 'y': 1065}} | Description: This action will tap on \"The Foster Museum\" to select it as the second museum for the itinerary. This is expected to open the details page for the museum. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The user is planning a one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA, focusing on museums and non-seafood dining options.  - Museums in Palo Alto, CA, have been searched on Tripadvisor, and the following options are displayed:   1. **Cantor Arts Center** - Art Museum with 483 reviews.   2. **The Foster Museum** - Speciality Museum and Art Museum with 32 reviews.   3. **Palo Alto Junior Museum & Zoo** - Children's Museum with 68 reviews.  - **Cantor Arts Center** has been successfully selected as one of the museums for the itinerary.   - **Cantor Arts Center** details:    - Rated 4.5 stars with 483 reviews.    - Ranked #2 of 68 things to do in Palo Alto.    - Category: Art Museums.    - Hours: 11:00 AM - 5:00 PM.    - Currently closed at the time of viewing.  - **The Foster Museum** has been identified as the second museum for the itinerary.   - **The Foster Museum** details:    - Rated 5.0 stars with 32 reviews.    - Ranked #8 of 68 things to do in Palo Alto.    - Category: Speciality Museums and Art Museums.    - Hours: 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM.    - Currently closed at the time of viewing.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 526, 'y': 386, 'text': 'museums in Palo Alto, CA'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"museums in Palo Alto, CA,\" and execute the search to display relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 679, 'y': 589}} | Description: This action will select the \"Cantor Arts Center\" option, the first museum on the list, to include it in the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 83, 'y': 159}} | Description: This action will tap the back button to return to the search results page, where I can locate and select \"The Foster Museum\" as the next museum for the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 683, 'y': 1065}} | Description: This action will tap on \"The Foster Museum\" to select it as the second museum for the itinerary.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The user is planning a one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA, focusing on museums and non-seafood dining options.  - Museums in Palo Alto, CA, have been searched on Tripadvisor, and the following options are displayed:   1. **Cantor Arts Center** - Art Museum with 483 reviews.   2. **The Foster Museum** - Speciality Museum and Art Museum with 32 reviews.   3. **Palo Alto Junior Museum & Zoo** - Children's Museum with 68 reviews.  - **Cantor Arts Center** has been successfully selected as one of the museums for the itinerary.   - **Cantor Arts Center** details:    - Rated 4.5 stars with 483 reviews.    - Ranked #2 of 68 things to do in Palo Alto.    - Category: Art Museums.    - Hours: 11:00 AM - 5:00 PM.    - Currently closed at the time of viewing.  - **The Foster Museum** has been identified as the second museum for the itinerary.   - **The Foster Museum** details:    - Rated 5.0 stars with 32 reviews.    - Ranked #8 of 68 things to do in Palo Alto.    - Category: Speciality Museums and Art Museums.    - Hours: 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM.    - Currently closed at the time of viewing.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 679, 'y': 589}} | Description: This action will select the \"Cantor Arts Center\" option, the first museum on the list, to include it in the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 83, 'y': 159}} | Description: This action will tap the back button to return to the search results page, where I can locate and select \"The Foster Museum\" as the next museum for the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 683, 'y': 1065}} | Description: This action will tap on \"The Foster Museum\" to select it as the second museum for the itinerary. This is expected to open the details page for the museum. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 849, 'y': 2269}} | Description: This action will tap the back button to return to the previous page in the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to proceed with searching for non-seafood restaurants in Palo Alto, CA. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 321, 'y': 2166}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Search\" icon at the bottom of the screen to open the search bar, allowing me to input the query for non-seafood restaurants in Palo Alto, CA. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 548, 'y': 430, 'text': 'non-seafood restaurants in Palo Alto, CA'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"non-seafood restaurants in Palo Alto, CA,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will display relevant results for non-seafood dining options in Palo Alto. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more restaurant options in the search results, allowing me to identify non-seafood restaurants for the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 317, 'y': 758}} | Description: This action will tap on **Reposado Restaurant** to open its details page and gather more information about the restaurant for the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will navigate back to the search results page, allowing me to select **Sundance The Steakhouse** and review its details. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 370, 'y': 1220}} | Description: This action will tap on **Sundance The Steakhouse** to open its details page and gather more information about the restaurant, such as its menu, reviews, and suitability for the user's preferences. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 317, 'y': 758}} | Description: This action will tap on **Reposado Restaurant** to open its details page and gather more information about the restaurant for the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will navigate back to the search results page, allowing me to select **Sundance The Steakhouse** and review its details. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 370, 'y': 1220}} | Description: This action will tap on **Sundance The Steakhouse** to open its details page and gather more information about the restaurant, such as its menu, reviews, and suitability for the user's preferences. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the Home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to write the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note and write the one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA, including the selected attractions and dining options. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The user is planning a one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA, focusing on museums and non-seafood dining options.  - Museums in Palo Alto, CA, have been searched on Tripadvisor, and the following options are displayed:   1. **Cantor Arts Center** - Art Museum with 483 reviews.   2. **The Foster Museum** - Speciality Museum and Art Museum with 32 reviews.   3. **Palo Alto Junior Museum & Zoo** - Children's Museum with 68 reviews.  - **Cantor Arts Center** has been successfully selected as one of the museums for the itinerary.   - **Cantor Arts Center** details:    - Rated 4.5 stars with 483 reviews.    - Ranked #2 of 68 things to do in Palo Alto.    - Category: Art Museums.    - Hours: 11:00 AM - 5:00 PM.    - Currently closed at the time of viewing.  - **The Foster Museum** has been identified as the second museum for the itinerary.   - **The Foster Museum** details:    - Rated 5.0 stars with 32 reviews.    - Ranked #8 of 68 things to do in Palo Alto.    - Category: Speciality Museums and Art Museums.    - Hours: 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM.    - Currently closed at the time of viewing.  - Restaurants in Palo Alto, CA, have been searched on Tripadvisor, and the following options are displayed:   1. **Red Lobster** - $$ - $$$ \u00b7 Seafood (Fairfield, California).   2. **The Sea by Alexander's Steakhouse** - $$$$ \u00b7 Steakhouse \u00b7 Seafood \u00b7 Gluten-free options (Palo Alto, California).   3. **Pacific Catch** - $$ - $$$ \u00b7 American \u00b7 Seafood \u00b7 Vegetarian-friendly (Mountain View, California).   4. **Reposado Restaurant** - $$ - $$$ \u00b7 Mexican \u00b7 Latin \u00b7 Vegetarian-friendly (Palo Alto, California).   5. **Sundance The Steakhouse** - $$$$ \u00b7 Steakhouse \u00b7 Seafood \u00b7 Vegetarian-friendly (Palo Alto, California).   6. **Waterbar** - $$$$ \u00b7 Seafood \u00b7 Vegetarian-friendly (San Francisco, California).   7. **Pier 23 Cafe Restaurant & Bar** (details not fully visible).  - The user does not like seafood, so restaurants with a primary focus on seafood should be excluded.  - **Reposado Restaurant** and **Sundance The Steakhouse** are potential options for non-seafood dining in Palo Alto.   - **Reposado Restaurant** details:    - Rated 4.0 stars with 429 reviews.    - Ranked #9 of 300 Restaurants in Palo Alto.    - Price range: $$ - $$$.    - Cuisine: Mexican, Latin, Vegetarian-friendly.   - **Sundance The Steakhouse** details:    - Rated 4.5 stars with 561 reviews.    - Ranked #3 of 300 Restaurants in Palo Alto.    - Price range: $$$$.    - Cuisine: Steakhouse, Seafood, Vegetarian-friendly.    - Offers reservation options via OpenTable.  - The Notes app has been successfully opened, allowing the user to create a new note and write the one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA, including the selected attractions (**Cantor Arts Center** and **The Foster Museum**) and dining options (**Sundance The Steakhouse** for dinner).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will navigate back to the search results page, allowing me to select **Sundance The Steakhouse** and review its details. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 370, 'y': 1220}} | Description: This action will tap on **Sundance The Steakhouse** to open its details page and gather more information about the restaurant, such as its menu, reviews, and suitability for the user's preferences. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the Home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to write the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note and write the one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA, including the selected attractions and dining options. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 544, 'y': 2269}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button to create a new note, allowing me to start writing the one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to tap the \"Add\" button in the Notes app to create a new note. However, the screen after the action shows the home screen of the device instead of the Notes app. This indicates that the app was exited instead of creating a new note. The potential reason could be an incorrect tap or a misinterpretation of the \"Add\" button's location.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 370, 'y': 1220}} | Description: This action will tap on **Sundance The Steakhouse** to open its details page and gather more information about the restaurant, such as its menu, reviews, and suitability for the user's preferences. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the Home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to write the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note and write the one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA, including the selected attractions and dining options. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 544, 'y': 2269}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button to create a new note, allowing me to start writing the one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to tap the \"Add\" button in the Notes app to create a new note. However, the screen after the action shows the home screen of the device instead of the Notes app. This indicates that the app was exited instead of creating a new note. The potential reason could be an incorrect tap or a misinterpretation of the \"Add\" button's location.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will reopen the Notes app, allowing me to retry creating a new note for the one-day itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The user is planning a one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA, focusing on museums and non-seafood dining options.  - Museums in Palo Alto, CA, have been searched on Tripadvisor, and the following options are displayed:   1. **Cantor Arts Center** - Art Museum with 483 reviews.   2. **The Foster Museum** - Speciality Museum and Art Museum with 32 reviews.   3. **Palo Alto Junior Museum & Zoo** - Children's Museum with 68 reviews.  - **Cantor Arts Center** has been successfully selected as one of the museums for the itinerary.   - **Cantor Arts Center** details:    - Rated 4.5 stars with 483 reviews.    - Ranked #2 of 68 things to do in Palo Alto.    - Category: Art Museums.    - Hours: 11:00 AM - 5:00 PM.    - Currently closed at the time of viewing.  - **The Foster Museum** has been identified as the second museum for the itinerary.   - **The Foster Museum** details:    - Rated 5.0 stars with 32 reviews.    - Ranked #8 of 68 things to do in Palo Alto.    - Category: Speciality Museums and Art Museums.    - Hours: 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM.    - Currently closed at the time of viewing.  - Restaurants in Palo Alto, CA, have been searched on Tripadvisor, and the following options are displayed:   1. **Red Lobster** - $$ - $$$ \u00b7 Seafood (Fairfield, California).   2. **The Sea by Alexander's Steakhouse** - $$$$ \u00b7 Steakhouse \u00b7 Seafood \u00b7 Gluten-free options (Palo Alto, California).   3. **Pacific Catch** - $$ - $$$ \u00b7 American \u00b7 Seafood \u00b7 Vegetarian-friendly (Mountain View, California).   4. **Reposado Restaurant** - $$ - $$$ \u00b7 Mexican \u00b7 Latin \u00b7 Vegetarian-friendly (Palo Alto, California).   5. **Sundance The Steakhouse** - $$$$ \u00b7 Steakhouse \u00b7 Seafood \u00b7 Vegetarian-friendly (Palo Alto, California).   6. **Waterbar** - $$$$ \u00b7 Seafood \u00b7 Vegetarian-friendly (San Francisco, California).   7. **Pier 23 Cafe Restaurant & Bar** (details not fully visible).  - The user does not like seafood, so restaurants with a primary focus on seafood should be excluded.  - **Reposado Restaurant** and **Sundance The Steakhouse** are potential options for non-seafood dining in Palo Alto.   - **Reposado Restaurant** details:    - Rated 4.0 stars with 429 reviews.    - Ranked #9 of 300 Restaurants in Palo Alto.    - Price range: $$ - $$$.    - Cuisine: Mexican, Latin, Vegetarian-friendly.   - **Sundance The Steakhouse** details:    - Rated 4.5 stars with 561 reviews.    - Ranked #3 of 300 Restaurants in Palo Alto.    - Price range: $$$$.    - Cuisine: Steakhouse, Seafood, Vegetarian-friendly.    - Offers reservation options via OpenTable.  - The Notes app has been successfully opened, allowing the user to create a new note and write the one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA, including the selected attractions (**Cantor Arts Center** and **The Foster Museum**) and dining options (**Sundance The Steakhouse** for dinner).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the Home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to write the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note and write the one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA, including the selected attractions and dining options. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 544, 'y': 2269}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button to create a new note, allowing me to start writing the one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to tap the \"Add\" button in the Notes app to create a new note. However, the screen after the action shows the home screen of the device instead of the Notes app. This indicates that the app was exited instead of creating a new note. The potential reason could be an incorrect tap or a misinterpretation of the \"Add\" button's location.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will reopen the Notes app, allowing me to retry creating a new note for the one-day itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 932, 'y': 2055}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button (red pencil icon) in the bottom-right corner of the Notes app to create a new note, allowing the user to start writing the one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 544, 'y': 2269}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button to create a new note, allowing me to start writing the one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to tap the \"Add\" button in the Notes app to create a new note. However, the screen after the action shows the home screen of the device instead of the Notes app. This indicates that the app was exited instead of creating a new note. The potential reason could be an incorrect tap or a misinterpretation of the \"Add\" button's location.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will reopen the Notes app, allowing me to retry creating a new note for the one-day itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 932, 'y': 2055}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button (red pencil icon) in the bottom-right corner of the Notes app to create a new note, allowing the user to start writing the one-day itinerary for Palo Alto, CA. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will switch to the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to search for breakfast and lunch options in Palo Alto, CA, to include in the itinerary. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 888, 'y': 206}} | Description: This action will tap the magnifying glass icon in the top-right corner of the Tripadvisor app to open the search bar, allowing me to search for breakfast and lunch options in Palo Alto, CA. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to tap the magnifying glass icon in the Tripadvisor app to open the search bar. However, the screen after the action shows the app switcher or home screen instead of the Tripadvisor app. This indicates that the app was either minimized or closed unintentionally.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",
