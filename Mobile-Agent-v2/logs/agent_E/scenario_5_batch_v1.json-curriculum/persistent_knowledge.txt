0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a "Back" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., "Save as file").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.  9. If scrolling through content does not reveal new information, consider alternative methods to locate the required details, such as using a search or filter function within the app.  10. If the end of a section is reached and the required information is not found, reassess the search criteria or explore other sections of the app for relevant details.  11. When searching for specific items (e.g., dishes, amenities), use keywords or filters to narrow down results and save time.  12. If repetitive actions (e.g., swiping) fail to yield results, pause and evaluate whether the task can be completed using a different approach or if the information is unavailable.  13. When switching between apps, ensure that the context of the task is maintained, and verify that the information gathered in one app aligns with the requirements in the other app.  14. Always confirm the proximity or location details (e.g., using Google Maps) before finalizing a selection, especially when location is a key criterion.
