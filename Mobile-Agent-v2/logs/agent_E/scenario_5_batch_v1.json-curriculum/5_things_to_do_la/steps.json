Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Tripadvisor'}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to search for the top attractions in Los Angeles. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new important notes to record. The current screen does not display the top 3 attractions in Los Angeles. Continue searching for the relevant information.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Tripadvisor'}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to search for the top attractions in Los Angeles. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 526, 'y': 386, 'text': 'Top attractions in Los Angeles'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Top attractions in Los Angeles,\" and execute the search to display relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Tripadvisor'}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to search for the top attractions in Los Angeles. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 526, 'y': 386, 'text': 'Top attractions in Los Angeles'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Top attractions in Los Angeles,\" and execute the search to display relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 722, 'y': 410}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Things to Do\" filter to refine the search results and display specific attractions in Los Angeles. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Top 3 attractions in Los Angeles according to the current screen:   1. **Battleship USS Iowa Museum** - 2,153 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   2. **Angels Flight Railway** - 444 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   3. **Universal Studios Hollywood** - 37,776 reviews, Los Angeles, California.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Tripadvisor'}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to search for the top attractions in Los Angeles. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 526, 'y': 386, 'text': 'Top attractions in Los Angeles'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Top attractions in Los Angeles,\" and execute the search to display relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 722, 'y': 410}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Things to Do\" filter to refine the search results and display specific attractions in Los Angeles. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to save the list of attractions. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Top 3 attractions in Los Angeles according to the current screen:   1. **Battleship USS Iowa Museum** - 2,153 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   2. **Angels Flight Railway** - 444 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   3. **Universal Studios Hollywood** - 37,776 reviews, Los Angeles, California.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Tripadvisor'}} | Description: This action will open the Tripadvisor app, allowing me to search for the top attractions in Los Angeles. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 526, 'y': 386, 'text': 'Top attractions in Los Angeles'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Top attractions in Los Angeles,\" and execute the search to display relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 722, 'y': 410}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Things to Do\" filter to refine the search results and display specific attractions in Los Angeles. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to save the list of attractions. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap on the Notes app icon to open it, allowing me to create a new note and save the list of top attractions in Los Angeles. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Top 3 attractions in Los Angeles according to the current screen:   1. **Battleship USS Iowa Museum** - 2,153 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   2. **Angels Flight Railway** - 444 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   3. **Universal Studios Hollywood** - 37,776 reviews, Los Angeles, California.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 526, 'y': 386, 'text': 'Top attractions in Los Angeles'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Top attractions in Los Angeles,\" and execute the search to display relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 722, 'y': 410}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Things to Do\" filter to refine the search results and display specific attractions in Los Angeles. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to save the list of attractions. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap on the Notes app icon to open it, allowing me to create a new note and save the list of top attractions in Los Angeles. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 931, 'y': 2056}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen to create a new note, enabling me to input the list of top attractions in Los Angeles. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

The list includes the names, review counts, and locations of the attractions. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 72, 'y': 2089}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen, saving the note and returning to the main Notes screen. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expected behavior was for the note to be saved and the app to return to the main Notes screen. However, the screen after the action remains on the same note editing page, indicating that the \"Back\" button was not successfully tapped or did not function as intended.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap on the Notes app icon to open it, allowing me to create a new note and save the list of top attractions in Los Angeles. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 931, 'y': 2056}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen to create a new note, enabling me to input the list of top attractions in Los Angeles. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Type', 'arguments': {'text': '1. **Battleship USS Iowa Museum** - 2,153 reviews, Los Angeles, California.\\n2. **Angels Flight Railway** - 444 reviews, Los Angeles, California.\\n3. **Universal Studios Hollywood** - 37,776 reviews, Los Angeles, California.'}} | Description: This action will type the list of the top 3 attractions in Los Angeles into the note. The list includes the names, review counts, and locations of the attractions. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 72, 'y': 2089}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen, saving the note and returning to the main Notes screen. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expected behavior was for the note to be saved and the app to return to the main Notes screen. However, the screen after the action remains on the same note editing page, indicating that the \"Back\" button was not successfully tapped or did not function as intended.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 72, 'y': 2089}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen to save the note and return to the main Notes screen. This should finalize the process of saving the list of attractions. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping the \"Back\" button did not result in any visible changes. The screen remains on the same note editing page, and the note has not been saved or exited to the main Notes screen. This could be due to the tap not registering correctly or the \"Back\" button not functioning as expected.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Top 3 attractions in Los Angeles according to the current screen:   1. **Battleship USS Iowa Museum** - 2,153 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   2. **Angels Flight Railway** - 444 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   3. **Universal Studios Hollywood** - 37,776 reviews, Los Angeles, California.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 931, 'y': 2056}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen to create a new note, enabling me to input the list of top attractions in Los Angeles. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Type', 'arguments': {'text': '1. **Battleship USS Iowa Museum** - 2,153 reviews, Los Angeles, California.\\n2. **Angels Flight Railway** - 444 reviews, Los Angeles, California.\\n3. **Universal Studios Hollywood** - 37,776 reviews, Los Angeles, California.'}} | Description: This action will type the list of the top 3 attractions in Los Angeles into the note. The list includes the names, review counts, and locations of the attractions. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 72, 'y': 2089}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen, saving the note and returning to the main Notes screen. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expected behavior was for the note to be saved and the app to return to the main Notes screen. However, the screen after the action remains on the same note editing page, indicating that the \"Back\" button was not successfully tapped or did not function as intended.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 72, 'y': 2089}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen to save the note and return to the main Notes screen. This should finalize the process of saving the list of attractions. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping the \"Back\" button did not result in any visible changes. The screen remains on the same note editing page, and the note has not been saved or exited to the main Notes screen. This could be due to the tap not registering correctly or the \"Back\" button not functioning as expected.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 988, 'y': 156}} | Description: This action will tap the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the screen to open additional options. I expect to find a \"Save\" or \"Exit\" option that will allow me to save the note and return to the main Notes screen. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Top 3 attractions in Los Angeles according to the current screen:   1. **Battleship USS Iowa Museum** - 2,153 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   2. **Angels Flight Railway** - 444 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   3. **Universal Studios Hollywood** - 37,776 reviews, Los Angeles, California.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Type', 'arguments': {'text': '1. **Battleship USS Iowa Museum** - 2,153 reviews, Los Angeles, California.\\n2. **Angels Flight Railway** - 444 reviews, Los Angeles, California.\\n3. **Universal Studios Hollywood** - 37,776 reviews, Los Angeles, California.'}} | Description: This action will type the list of the top 3 attractions in Los Angeles into the note. The list includes the names, review counts, and locations of the attractions. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 72, 'y': 2089}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen, saving the note and returning to the main Notes screen. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expected behavior was for the note to be saved and the app to return to the main Notes screen. However, the screen after the action remains on the same note editing page, indicating that the \"Back\" button was not successfully tapped or did not function as intended.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 72, 'y': 2089}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen to save the note and return to the main Notes screen. This should finalize the process of saving the list of attractions. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping the \"Back\" button did not result in any visible changes. The screen remains on the same note editing page, and the note has not been saved or exited to the main Notes screen. This could be due to the tap not registering correctly or the \"Back\" button not functioning as expected.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 988, 'y': 156}} | Description: This action will tap the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the screen to open additional options. I expect to find a \"Save\" or \"Exit\" option that will allow me to save the note and return to the main Notes screen. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 484, 'y': 1635}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Save as file\" option in the menu, which is expected to save the note as a file. This should complete the process of saving the list of attractions. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[97, 41]; text: 8:36\n[990, 215]; text: \u4e09\n[240, 213]; text: Select folder\n[875, 214]; text: \u5341\n[367, 359]; text: Internal storage\n[996, 485]; text: \u4e2a\n[856, 485]; text: Name\n[310, 601]; text: Alarms\n[946, 660]; text: 0 items\n[370, 662]; text: Sep 8 10:32 PM\n[321, 800]; text: Android\n[947, 860]; text: 3 items\n[367, 859]; text: Sep 8 10:32 PM\n[369, 1029]; text: Audiobooks\nSep 8 10:32 PM\n[946, 1058]; text: 0 items\n[300, 1200]; text: DCIM\n[958, 1258]; text: 1 item\n[367, 1258]; text: Dec 15 8:13 PM\n[367, 1427]; text: Documents\nDec 12 1:40 PM\n[959, 1457]; text: 1 item\n[373, 1628]; text: Download\nDec 15 11:05 AM\n[947, 1656]; text: 3 items\n[313, 1795]; text: Movies\n[946, 1854]; text: 0 items\n[368, 1853]; text: Sep 8 10:32 PM\n[301, 1996]; text: Music\n[406, 2053]; text: ^^._^-.\n[538, 2126]; text: Done\n[851, 2269]; text: <\n[542, 2270]; text: O\n[123, 833]; icon: The icon is a square with rounded corners, featuring a gear-shaped symbol inside it, all in shades of gray.\n[123, 1231]; icon: The app logo shows a blue camera inside a white square with rounded corners, enclosed by a gray rectangle with dotted lines.\n[118, 627]; icon: This is an icon.\n[123, 1828]; icon: The icon is a square with rounded corners, filled with grayish-blue color.\n[123, 1431]; icon: The file folder has a square shape with rounded corners, colored light gray (silver).\n[122, 2017]; icon: The icon is a square with rounded corners, filled with blueish-purple color.\n[123, 1629]; icon: The icon is a square with rounded corners, filled with blueish-purple shading and featuring a white downward-pointing arrow at its center.\n[107, 358]; icon: This is an icon.\n[117, 1024]; icon: The folder icon on the phone screen has a square shape with rounded corners, colored in light blue.\n[145, 850]; icon: This is an icon.\n[875, 213]; icon: This is an icon.\n[543, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black border, and has two thin horizontal lines inside.\n[963, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[986, 212]; icon: The icon is shaped like a piece of paper with a corner folded over, and it has a white background with black lines outlining the edges.\n[145, 1647]; icon: This is an icon.\n[145, 1247]; icon: The camera icon has a rectangular shape with rounded corners, depicted in black on a white background.\n[766, 481]; icon: The icon is shaped like a house with a person inside, depicted in black on a white background.\n[215, 42]; icon: The icon is shaped like a horizontal line with rounded ends, and it's colored black.\n[145, 1447]; icon: The icon is square-shaped with rounded corners, white in color, and depicts two overlapping files or papers.\n[97, 42]; icon: The time icon on the phone screen has a white background with black numbers, representing the current time as \"8:36\".\n[926, 40]; icon: The icon is a white circle with a black outline, representing two arrows moving in opposite directions against a gray background.\n[996, 482]; icon: The direction arrow on the phone screen is white with a black outline, pointing upwards.\n[144, 41]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black outline, featuring two intersecting lines forming a heart symbol inside a circle.\n[169, 42]; icon: The icon is circular, with a white heart symbol centered inside a blue ring.\n[145, 1846]; icon: The icon is a circle with a white outline and filled with blue, centered on a solid black background.\n[144, 2034]; icon: The icon is shaped like a rounded rectangle with blue fill, featuring white text that reads \"d\" inside it.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Top 3 attractions in Los Angeles according to the current screen:   1. **Battleship USS Iowa Museum** - 2,153 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   2. **Angels Flight Railway** - 444 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   3. **Universal Studios Hollywood** - 37,776 reviews, Los Angeles, California.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 72, 'y': 2089}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen, saving the note and returning to the main Notes screen. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expected behavior was for the note to be saved and the app to return to the main Notes screen. However, the screen after the action remains on the same note editing page, indicating that the \"Back\" button was not successfully tapped or did not function as intended.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 72, 'y': 2089}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen to save the note and return to the main Notes screen. This should finalize the process of saving the list of attractions. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping the \"Back\" button did not result in any visible changes. The screen remains on the same note editing page, and the note has not been saved or exited to the main Notes screen. This could be due to the tap not registering correctly or the \"Back\" button not functioning as expected.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 988, 'y': 156}} | Description: This action will tap the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the screen to open additional options. I expect to find a \"Save\" or \"Exit\" option that will allow me to save the note and return to the main Notes screen. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 484, 'y': 1635}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Save as file\" option in the menu, which is expected to save the note as a file. This should complete the process of saving the list of attractions. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 457, 'y': 963}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Text file\" option in the \"Save note as\" menu, selecting it as the file format for saving the note. This should proceed to the next step in the saving process. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Top 3 attractions in Los Angeles according to the current screen:   1. **Battleship USS Iowa Museum** - 2,153 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   2. **Angels Flight Railway** - 444 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   3. **Universal Studios Hollywood** - 37,776 reviews, Los Angeles, California.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 72, 'y': 2089}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen to save the note and return to the main Notes screen. This should finalize the process of saving the list of attractions. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping the \"Back\" button did not result in any visible changes. The screen remains on the same note editing page, and the note has not been saved or exited to the main Notes screen. This could be due to the tap not registering correctly or the \"Back\" button not functioning as expected.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 988, 'y': 156}} | Description: This action will tap the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the screen to open additional options. I expect to find a \"Save\" or \"Exit\" option that will allow me to save the note and return to the main Notes screen. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 484, 'y': 1635}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Save as file\" option in the menu, which is expected to save the note as a file. This should complete the process of saving the list of attractions. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 457, 'y': 963}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Text file\" option in the \"Save note as\" menu, selecting it as the file format for saving the note. This should proceed to the next step in the saving process. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 367, 'y': 1427}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Documents\" folder to select it as the location for saving the note. After this, I will confirm the selection by tapping the \"Done\" button. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has been activated and you can type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Top 3 attractions in Los Angeles according to the current screen:   1. **Battleship USS Iowa Museum** - 2,153 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   2. **Angels Flight Railway** - 444 reviews, Los Angeles, California.   3. **Universal Studios Hollywood** - 37,776 reviews, Los Angeles, California.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 988, 'y': 156}} | Description: This action will tap the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the screen to open additional options. I expect to find a \"Save\" or \"Exit\" option that will allow me to save the note and return to the main Notes screen. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 484, 'y': 1635}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Save as file\" option in the menu, which is expected to save the note as a file. This should complete the process of saving the list of attractions. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 457, 'y': 963}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Text file\" option in the \"Save note as\" menu, selecting it as the file format for saving the note. This should proceed to the next step in the saving process. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 367, 'y': 1427}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Documents\" folder to select it as the location for saving the note. After this, I will confirm the selection by tapping the \"Done\" button. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 538, 'y': 2126}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Done\" button to confirm the selection of the \"Documents\" folder as the save location. This should finalize the process of saving the note. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Choose the attractions and dining recommendations, but keep in mind that I don't like seafood and I love museums. Write the plan in Notes.\n- Find a highly recommended local restaurant in Chicago on Tripadvisor. Check the reviews about must-try dishes and summarize in Notes.\n- Help me find a hotel in Champaign, IL on Booking that is under $200 for a queen bed. Make sure that the rating is higher than 7.0. Double check on Google Maps to see if it is close to the Green Street. Show me your final choice on Booking.\n\n---\nCarefully reflect on the interaction history of the current task. Check if there are any subgoals that are accomplished by a sequence of successful actions and can be consolidated into new \"Shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions. For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",
