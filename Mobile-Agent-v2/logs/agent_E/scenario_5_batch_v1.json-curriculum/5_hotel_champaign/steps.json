Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.  9. If scrolling through content does not reveal new information, consider alternative methods to locate the required details, such as using a search or filter function within the app.  10. If the end of a section is reached and the required information is not found, reassess the search criteria or explore other sections of the app for relevant details.  11. When searching for specific items (e.g., dishes, amenities), use keywords or filters to narrow down results and save time.  12. If repetitive actions (e.g., swiping) fail to yield results, pause and evaluate whether the task can be completed using a different approach or if the information is unavailable.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.  9. If scrolling through content does not reveal new information, consider alternative methods to locate the required details, such as using a search or filter function within the app.  10. If the end of a section is reached and the required information is not found, reassess the search criteria or explore other sections of the app for relevant details.  11. When searching for specific items (e.g., dishes, amenities), use keywords or filters to narrow down results and save time.  12. If repetitive actions (e.g., swiping) fail to yield results, pause and evaluate whether the task can be completed using a different approach or if the information is unavailable.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.  9. If scrolling through content does not reveal new information, consider alternative methods to locate the required details, such as using a search or filter function within the app.  10. If the end of a section is reached and the required information is not found, reassess the search criteria or explore other sections of the app for relevant details.  11. When searching for specific items (e.g., dishes, amenities), use keywords or filters to narrow down results and save time.  12. If repetitive actions (e.g., swiping) fail to yield results, pause and evaluate whether the task can be completed using a different approach or if the information is unavailable.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The Booking.com app is open and ready for searching. - Current search parameters:  - Location: Champaign, IL  - Dates: Sun, Dec 15 - Mon, Dec 16  - Guests: 1 room, 2 adults, 0 children\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Booking.com'}} | Description: This action will open the Booking.com app, allowing me to proceed with searching for hotels in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.  9. If scrolling through content does not reveal new information, consider alternative methods to locate the required details, such as using a search or filter function within the app.  10. If the end of a section is reached and the required information is not found, reassess the search criteria or explore other sections of the app for relevant details.  11. When searching for specific items (e.g., dishes, amenities), use keywords or filters to narrow down results and save time.  12. If repetitive actions (e.g., swiping) fail to yield results, pause and evaluate whether the task can be completed using a different approach or if the information is unavailable.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The Booking.com app is open and ready for searching.  - Current search parameters:   - Location: Champaign, IL   - Dates: Sun, Dec 15 - Mon, Dec 16   - Guests: 1 room, 2 adults, 0 children  - Two hotels are visible in the current search results:   1. **Americas Best Value Inn Champaign**:    - Rating: 5.4 (Fair, 102 reviews)    - Price: $50 (Mobile-only price)    - Distance: 1.5 miles from downtown    - Room: 2 beds   2. **Home2 Suites by Hilton Champaign/Urbana**:    - Rating: 7.5 (Good, 113 reviews)    - Price: $114    - Distance: 1.7 miles from downtown    - Room: 1 bed, 1 bedroom (355.2 ft\u00b2)    - Breakfast included    - Sustainability certification    - No prepayment needed\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Booking.com'}} | Description: This action will open the Booking.com app, allowing me to proceed with searching for hotels in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 538, 'y': 1015}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Search\" button to display the list of hotels in Champaign, IL, for the specified dates and guests. Once the results are displayed, I can apply the necessary filters. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.  9. If scrolling through content does not reveal new information, consider alternative methods to locate the required details, such as using a search or filter function within the app.  10. If the end of a section is reached and the required information is not found, reassess the search criteria or explore other sections of the app for relevant details.  11. When searching for specific items (e.g., dishes, amenities), use keywords or filters to narrow down results and save time.  12. If repetitive actions (e.g., swiping) fail to yield results, pause and evaluate whether the task can be completed using a different approach or if the information is unavailable.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The Booking.com app is open and ready for searching.  - Current search parameters:   - Location: Champaign, IL   - Dates: Sun, Dec 15 - Mon, Dec 16   - Guests: 1 room, 2 adults, 0 children  - Two hotels are visible in the current search results:   1. **Americas Best Value Inn Champaign**:    - Rating: 5.4 (Fair, 102 reviews)    - Price: $50 (Mobile-only price)    - Distance: 1.5 miles from downtown    - Room: 2 beds   2. **Home2 Suites by Hilton Champaign/Urbana**:    - Rating: 7.5 (Good, 113 reviews)    - Price: $114    - Distance: 1.7 miles from downtown    - Room: 1 bed, 1 bedroom (355.2 ft\u00b2)    - Breakfast included    - Sustainability certification    - No prepayment needed  - The app switcher has been opened successfully, allowing navigation to Google Maps to check the proximity of \"Home2 Suites by Hilton Champaign/Urbana\" to Green Street.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Booking.com'}} | Description: This action will open the Booking.com app, allowing me to proceed with searching for hotels in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 538, 'y': 1015}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Search\" button to display the list of hotels in Champaign, IL, for the specified dates and guests. Once the results are displayed, I can apply the necessary filters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to navigate to Google Maps to check the proximity of \"Home2 Suites by Hilton Champaign/Urbana\" to Green Street. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.  9. If scrolling through content does not reveal new information, consider alternative methods to locate the required details, such as using a search or filter function within the app.  10. If the end of a section is reached and the required information is not found, reassess the search criteria or explore other sections of the app for relevant details.  11. When searching for specific items (e.g., dishes, amenities), use keywords or filters to narrow down results and save time.  12.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Booking.com'}} | Description: This action will open the Booking.com app, allowing me to proceed with searching for hotels in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 538, 'y': 1015}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Search\" button to display the list of hotels in Champaign, IL, for the specified dates and guests. Once the results are displayed, I can apply the necessary filters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to navigate to Google Maps to check the proximity of \"Home2 Suites by Hilton Champaign/Urbana\" to Green Street. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 915, 'y': 2077}} | Description: This action will tap on the Google Maps app icon in the app switcher, opening the app to check the proximity of \"Home2 Suites by Hilton Champaign/Urbana\" to Green Street. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.  9. If scrolling through content does not reveal new information, consider alternative methods to locate the required details, such as using a search or filter function within the app.  10. If the end of a section is reached and the required information is not found, reassess the search criteria or explore other sections of the app for relevant details.  11. When searching for specific items (e.g., dishes, amenities), use keywords or filters to narrow down results and save time.  12. If repetitive actions (e.g., swiping) fail to yield results, pause and evaluate whether the task can be completed using a different approach or if the information is unavailable.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The Booking.com app is open and ready for searching.  - Current search parameters:   - Location: Champaign, IL   - Dates: Sun, Dec 15 - Mon, Dec 16   - Guests: 1 room, 2 adults, 0 children  - Two hotels are visible in the current search results:   1. **Americas Best Value Inn Champaign**:    - Rating: 5.4 (Fair, 102 reviews)    - Price: $50 (Mobile-only price)    - Distance: 1.5 miles from downtown    - Room: 2 beds   2. **Home2 Suites by Hilton Champaign/Urbana**:    - Rating: 7.5 (Good, 113 reviews)    - Price: $114    - Distance: 1.7 miles from downtown    - Room: 1 bed, 1 bedroom (355.2 ft\u00b2)    - Breakfast included    - Sustainability certification    - No prepayment needed  - The app switcher has been opened successfully, allowing navigation to Google Maps to check the proximity of \"Home2 Suites by Hilton Champaign/Urbana\" to Green Street.  - Google Maps is open, and the map shows the area around Midtown Champaign, including E White St, E Springfield Ave, and Campustown.  - The location of \"Home2 Suites by Hilton Champaign/Urbana\" is visible on Google Maps.   - It is a 6-minute drive from Green Street.   - The hotel is eco-certified and offers modern all-suite accommodations with a pool and gym.   - Price: $93 for Dec 15-16.  - \"Home2 Suites by Hilton Champaign/Urbana\" meets the user's requirements:   - Price: Under $200   - Rating: Higher than 7.0   - Proximity: Close to Green Street (6-minute drive).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Save_Note_As_File(folder_x, folder_y, done_x, done_y, save_x, save_y): Save a note as a file in a specified folder by selecting the folder, confirming the selection, and tapping the save button. | Precondition: The 'Save note as' menu is open, and the desired folder, 'Done' button, and 'Save' button are visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Booking.com'}} | Description: This action will open the Booking.com app, allowing me to proceed with searching for hotels in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 538, 'y': 1015}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Search\" button to display the list of hotels in Champaign, IL, for the specified dates and guests. Once the results are displayed, I can apply the necessary filters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to navigate to Google Maps to check the proximity of \"Home2 Suites by Hilton Champaign/Urbana\" to Green Street. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 915, 'y': 2077}} | Description: This action will tap on the Google Maps app icon in the app switcher, opening the app to check the proximity of \"Home2 Suites by Hilton Champaign/Urbana\" to Green Street. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 170, 'text': 'Home2 Suites by Hilton Champaign/Urbana'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar in Google Maps, type \"Home2 Suites by Hilton Champaign/Urbana,\" and press Enter to locate the hotel on the map. This will help assess its proximity to Green Street. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.  9. If scrolling through content does not reveal new information, consider alternative methods to locate the required details, such as using a search or filter function within the app.  10. If the end of a section is reached and the required information is not found, reassess the search criteria or explore other sections of the app for relevant details.  11. When searching for specific items (e.g., dishes, amenities), use keywords or filters to narrow down results and save time.  12.

By default, no apps are opened in the background.  \n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  \n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  \n4. Always confirm that the displayed results match the search criteria (e.g., correct cities, dates, and round-trip selection) before proceeding to the next step.  \n5. If multiple options are displayed, ensure the cheapest or most relevant option is clearly identified and selected as per the task requirements.  \n6. If a \"Back\" button fails to function as expected, consider alternative methods to save or exit, such as using a menu or additional options (e.g., \"Save as file\").  \n7. When saving a note as a file, ensure the correct folder and file format are selected before confirming the save.  \n8. Double-check that the task is fully completed (e.g., the note is saved in the correct location) before marking it as done.  \n9. If scrolling through content does not reveal new information, consider alternative methods to locate the required details, such as using a search or filter function within the app.  \n10. If the end of a section is reached and the required information is not found, reassess the search criteria or explore other sections of the app for relevant details.  \n11. When searching for specific items (e.g., dishes, amenities), use keywords or filters to narrow down results and save time.  \n12. If repetitive actions (e.g., swiping) fail to yield results, pause and evaluate whether the task can be completed using a different approach or if the information is unavailable.  \n13. When switching between apps, ensure that the context of the task is maintained, and verify that the information gathered in one app aligns with the requirements in the other app.  \n14. Always confirm the proximity or location details (e.g., using Google Maps) before finalizing a selection, especially when location is a key criterion."
