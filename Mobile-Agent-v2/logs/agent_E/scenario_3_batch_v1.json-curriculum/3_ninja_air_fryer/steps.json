Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform.

The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 414, 'y': 1410}} | Description: This action will tap on the Walmart app icon to open it, allowing us to proceed with searching for the \"Ninja air fryer 8 qt.\" | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The price of the Ninja Foodi 4-in-1, 8 Qt. 2-Basket Air Fryer with DualZone Technology on Walmart is as follows:  - **$98.00** (discounted from $169.00) with free shipping, arriving in 2 days.  - Another listing shows a price of **$129.00**.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 414, 'y': 1410}} | Description: This action will tap on the Walmart app icon to open it, allowing us to proceed with searching for the \"Ninja air fryer 8 qt.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 539, 'y': 323, 'text': 'Ninja air fryer 8 qt'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Ninja air fryer 8 qt,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will display the relevant results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones: - The price of the Ninja Foodi 4-in-1, 8 Qt. 2-Basket Air Fryer with DualZone Technology on Walmart is as follows:   - **$98.00** (discounted from $169.00) with free shipping, arriving in 2 days.   - Another listing shows a price of **$129.00**.  No new information to add from the current screen. The next step is to open the Amazon Shopping app and search for the same product to compare prices.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 414, 'y': 1410}} | Description: This action will tap on the Walmart app icon to open it, allowing us to proceed with searching for the \"Ninja air fryer 8 qt.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 539, 'y': 323, 'text': 'Ninja air fryer 8 qt'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Ninja air fryer 8 qt,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will display the relevant results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Amazon Shopping app to proceed with the search. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The price of the Ninja Foodi 4-in-1, 8 Qt. 2-Basket Air Fryer with DualZone Technology on Walmart is as follows:   - **$98.00** (discounted from $169.00) with free shipping, arriving in 2 days.   - Another listing shows a price of **$129.00**.  No new information to add from the current screen. The next step is to search for \"Ninja air fryer 8 qt\" in the Amazon Shopping app to compare prices.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 414, 'y': 1410}} | Description: This action will tap on the Walmart app icon to open it, allowing us to proceed with searching for the \"Ninja air fryer 8 qt.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 539, 'y': 323, 'text': 'Ninja air fryer 8 qt'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Ninja air fryer 8 qt,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will display the relevant results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Amazon Shopping app to proceed with the search. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Amazon Shopping'}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to search for the \"Ninja air fryer 8 qt\" and compare its price with the Walmart listing. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The price of the Ninja Foodi 4-in-1, 8 Qt. 2-Basket Air Fryer with DualZone Technology on Walmart is as follows:   - **$98.00** (discounted from $169.00) with free shipping, arriving in 2 days.   - Another listing shows a price of **$129.00**.  - No relevant price information for the Ninja air fryer 8 qt is visible on the current Amazon screen. The next step is to continue reviewing Amazon listings for the product.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 414, 'y': 1410}} | Description: This action will tap on the Walmart app icon to open it, allowing us to proceed with searching for the \"Ninja air fryer 8 qt.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 539, 'y': 323, 'text': 'Ninja air fryer 8 qt'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Ninja air fryer 8 qt,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will display the relevant results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Amazon Shopping app to proceed with the search. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Amazon Shopping'}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to search for the \"Ninja air fryer 8 qt\" and compare its price with the Walmart listing. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Ninja air fryer 8 qt'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Ninja air fryer 8 qt,\" and initiate the search in the Amazon Shopping app. This will display the relevant results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Find the cheapest option and stop at the screen where I can add it to the cart.\n\n---\nCarefully reflect on the interaction history of the current task. Check if there are any subgoals that are accomplished by a sequence of successful actions and can be consolidated into new \"Shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions. For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.\n\n### Full Action History ###\n- Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 414, 'y': 1410}} | Description: This action will tap on the Walmart app icon to open it, allowing us to proceed with searching for the \"Ninja air fryer 8 qt.\" | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The Walmart app has been successfully opened.
