Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Amazon Shopping'}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to proceed with searching for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con.\" | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed. - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo. - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews. - No price information is visible on the current screen. Further action is needed to check the price.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Amazon Shopping'}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to proceed with searching for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Nintendo Switch Joy-Con'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con,\" and perform the search, displaying relevant results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed.  - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo.  - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews.  - Over 2,000 units were bought in the past month.  - The product color is \"Blue and Neon Yellow.\"  - No price information is visible on the current screen. Further action is needed to check the price.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Amazon Shopping'}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to proceed with searching for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Nintendo Switch Joy-Con'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con,\" and perform the search, displaying relevant results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 716, 'y': 1832}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" product to open its details page and view the price. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed.  - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo.  - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews.  - Over 2,000 units were bought in the past month.  - The product color is \"Blue and Neon Yellow.\"  - The price of the product on Amazon is **$85.00**.  - Free returns are available.  - Includes a $2.00 Amazon discount.  - Free delivery is estimated between December 28 and January 3, with the fastest delivery option between December 26 and 29.  - The product will arrive after Christmas.  Next step: Compare this price with the prices on Walmart and Best Buy.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Amazon Shopping'}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to proceed with searching for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Nintendo Switch Joy-Con'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con,\" and perform the search, displaying relevant results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 716, 'y': 1832}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" product to open its details page and view the price. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, which may include the price of the product. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed.   - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo.   - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews.   - Over 2,000 units were bought in the past month.   - The product color is \"Blue and Neon Yellow.\"   - The price of the product on Amazon is **$85.00**.   - Free returns are available.   - Includes a $2.00 Amazon discount.   - Free delivery is estimated between December 28 and January 3, with the fastest delivery option between December 26 and 29.   - The product will arrive after Christmas.  - Next step: Compare this price with the prices on Walmart and Best Buy.  - The Walmart app is now accessible from the Home screen. The next step is to open the Walmart app and search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con.\"\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Amazon Shopping'}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to proceed with searching for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Nintendo Switch Joy-Con'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con,\" and perform the search, displaying relevant results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 716, 'y': 1832}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" product to open its details page and view the price. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, which may include the price of the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the Home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Walmart app to proceed with the price comparison. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed.   - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo.   - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews.   - Over 2,000 units were bought in the past month.   - The product color is \"Blue and Neon Yellow.\"   - The price of the product on Amazon is **$85.00**.   - Free returns are available.   - Includes a $2.00 Amazon discount.   - Free delivery is estimated between December 28 and January 3, with the fastest delivery option between December 26 and 29.   - The product will arrive after Christmas.  - Next step: Compare this price with the prices on Walmart and Best Buy.  - The Walmart app is now accessible from the Home screen. The next step is to open the Walmart app and search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con.\"\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Nintendo Switch Joy-Con'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con,\" and perform the search, displaying relevant results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 716, 'y': 1832}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" product to open its details page and view the price. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, which may include the price of the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the Home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Walmart app to proceed with the price comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Walmart'}} | Description: This action will open the Walmart app, allowing me to proceed with searching for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" and comparing its price with the one found on Amazon. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones: - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed.   - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo.   - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews.   - Over 2,000 units were bought in the past month.   - The product color is \"Blue and Neon Yellow.\"   - The price of the product on Amazon is **$85.00**.   - Free returns are available.   - Includes a $2.00 Amazon discount.   - Free delivery is estimated between December 28 and January 3, with the fastest delivery option between December 26 and 29.   - The product will arrive after Christmas.  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" in the Walmart app has been initiated.   - The current screen shows search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" (307 results).   - A sponsored product is displayed: \"Nintendo Switch \u2013 OLED Model Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle\" priced at **$349.00**.   - This product is not relevant to the user's request for Joy-Con controllers.   - Further review of the search results is needed to identify a suitable product for comparison.  - Next step: Continue reviewing the Walmart search results to find a relevant Joy-Con product and note its price for comparison.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 716, 'y': 1832}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" product to open its details page and view the price. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, which may include the price of the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the Home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Walmart app to proceed with the price comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Walmart'}} | Description: This action will open the Walmart app, allowing me to proceed with searching for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" and comparing its price with the one found on Amazon. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 233, 'y': 326, 'text': 'Nintendo Switch Joy-Con'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con,\" and perform the search to display relevant results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed.   - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo.   - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews.   - Over 2,000 units were bought in the past month.   - The product color is \"Blue and Neon Yellow.\"   - The price of the product on Amazon is **$85.00**.   - Free returns are available.   - Includes a $2.00 Amazon discount.   - Free delivery is estimated between December 28 and January 3, with the fastest delivery option between December 26 and 29.   - The product will arrive after Christmas.  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" in the Walmart app has been initiated.   - The current screen shows search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" (307 results).   - A sponsored product is displayed: \"Nintendo Switch \u2013 OLED Model Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle\" priced at **$349.00**.   - This product is not relevant to the user's request for Joy-Con controllers.   - A product titled \"Bonadget Joypad (L/R) for Nintendo Switch, Gamepad\" is visible, priced at **$24.75**.   - This product may not be an official Nintendo Joy-Con.

Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, which may include the price of the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the Home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Walmart app to proceed with the price comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Walmart'}} | Description: This action will open the Walmart app, allowing me to proceed with searching for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" and comparing its price with the one found on Amazon. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 233, 'y': 326, 'text': 'Nintendo Switch Joy-Con'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con,\" and perform the search to display relevant results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Walmart. This will help identify a relevant product for comparison. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed.   - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo.   - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews.   - Over 2,000 units were bought in the past month.   - The product color is \"Blue and Neon Yellow.\"   - The price of the product on Amazon is **$85.00**.   - Free returns are available.   - Includes a $2.00 Amazon discount.   - Free delivery is estimated between December 28 and January 3, with the fastest delivery option between December 26 and 29.   - The product will arrive after Christmas.  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" in the Walmart app has been initiated.   - The current screen shows search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" (307 results).   - A sponsored product is displayed: \"Nintendo Switch \u2013 OLED Model Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle\" priced at **$349.00**.   - This product is not relevant to the user's request for Joy-Con controllers.   - A product titled \"Bonadget Joypad (L/R) for Nintendo Switch, Gamepad\" is visible, priced at **$24.75**.   - This product may not be an official Nintendo Joy-Con.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the Home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Walmart app to proceed with the price comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Walmart'}} | Description: This action will open the Walmart app, allowing me to proceed with searching for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" and comparing its price with the one found on Amazon. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 233, 'y': 326, 'text': 'Nintendo Switch Joy-Con'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con,\" and perform the search to display relevant results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Walmart.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed.   - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo.   - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews.   - Over 2,000 units were bought in the past month.   - The product color is \"Blue and Neon Yellow.\"   - The price of the product on Amazon is **$85.00**.   - Free returns are available.   - Includes a $2.00 Amazon discount.   - Free delivery is estimated between December 28 and January 3, with the fastest delivery option between December 26 and 29.   - The product will arrive after Christmas.  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" in the Walmart app has been initiated.   - The current screen shows search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" (307 results).   - A sponsored product is displayed: \"Nintendo Switch \u2013 OLED Model Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle\" priced at **$349.00**.   - This product is not relevant to the user's request for Joy-Con controllers.   - A product titled \"Bonadget Joypad (L/R) for Nintendo Switch, Gamepad\" is visible, priced at **$24.75**.   - This product may not be an official Nintendo Joy-Con.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed.   - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo.   - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews.   - Over 2,000 units were bought in the past month.   - The product color is \"Blue and Neon Yellow.\"   - The price of the product on Amazon is **$85.00**.   - Free returns are available.   - Includes a $2.00 Amazon discount.   - Free delivery is estimated between December 28 and January 3, with the fastest delivery option between December 26 and 29.   - The product will arrive after Christmas.  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" in the Walmart app has been initiated.   - The current screen shows search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" (307 results).   - A sponsored product is displayed: \"Nintendo Switch \u2013 OLED Model Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle\" priced at **$349.00**.   - This product is not relevant to the user's request for Joy-Con controllers.   - A product titled \"Bonadget Joypad (L/R) for Nintendo Switch, Gamepad\" is visible, priced at **$24.75**.   - This product may not be an official Nintendo Joy-Con.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 233, 'y': 326, 'text': 'Nintendo Switch Joy-Con'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con,\" and perform the search to display relevant results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Walmart. This will help identify a relevant product for comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more search results, potentially including an official Nintendo Joy-Con product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Walmart. The goal is to locate an official Nintendo Joy-Con product for price comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Best Buy'}} | Description: This action will open the Best Buy app, allowing me to search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" and note the price for comparison. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to open the Best Buy app, but the screen after the action still shows the Walmart app interface. This indicates that the Best Buy app was not successfully opened, and the user remains on the Walmart app.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content: Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed.   - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo.   - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews.   - Over 2,000 units were bought in the past month.   - The product color is \"Blue and Neon Yellow.\"   - The price of the product on Amazon is **$85.00**.   - Free returns are available.   - Includes a $2.00 Amazon discount.   - Free delivery is estimated between December 28 and January 3, with the fastest delivery option between December 26 and 29.   - The product will arrive after Christmas.  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" in the Walmart app has been initiated.   - The current screen shows search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" (307 results).   - A sponsored product is displayed: \"Nintendo Switch \u2013 OLED Model Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle\" priced at **$349.00**.   - This product is not relevant to the user's request for Joy-Con controllers.   - A product titled \"Bonadget Joypad (L/R) for Nintendo Switch, Gamepad\" is visible, priced at **$24.75**.   - This product may not be an official Nintendo Joy-Con.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated.

This indicates that the Best Buy app was not successfully opened, and the user remains on the Walmart app.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to attempt reopening the Best Buy app from the home screen. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed.   - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo.   - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews.   - Over 2,000 units were bought in the past month.   - The product color is \"Blue and Neon Yellow.\"   - The price of the product on Amazon is **$85.00**.   - Free returns are available.   - Includes a $2.00 Amazon discount.   - Free delivery is estimated between December 28 and January 3, with the fastest delivery option between December 26 and 29.   - The product will arrive after Christmas.  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" in the Walmart app has been initiated.   - The current screen shows search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" (307 results).   - A sponsored product is displayed: \"Nintendo Switch \u2013 OLED Model Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle\" priced at **$349.00**.   - This product is not relevant to the user's request for Joy-Con controllers.   - A product titled \"Bonadget Joypad (L/R) for Nintendo Switch, Gamepad\" is visible, priced at **$24.75**.   - This product may not be an official Nintendo Joy-Con.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more search results, potentially including an official Nintendo Joy-Con product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Walmart. The goal is to locate an official Nintendo Joy-Con product for price comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Best Buy'}} | Description: This action will open the Best Buy app, allowing me to search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" and note the price for comparison. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to open the Best Buy app, but the screen after the action still shows the Walmart app interface. This indicates that the Best Buy app was not successfully opened, and the user remains on the Walmart app.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to attempt reopening the Best Buy app from the home screen. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Best Buy'}} | Description: This action will open the Best Buy app, allowing me to search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" and note the price for comparison. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed.   - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo.   - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews.   - Over 2,000 units were bought in the past month.   - The product color is \"Blue and Neon Yellow.\"   - The price of the product on Amazon is **$85.00**.   - Free returns are available.   - Includes a $2.00 Amazon discount.   - Free delivery is estimated between December 28 and January 3, with the fastest delivery option between December 26 and 29.   - The product will arrive after Christmas.  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" in the Walmart app has been initiated.   - The current screen shows search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" (307 results).   - A sponsored product is displayed: \"Nintendo Switch \u2013 OLED Model Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle\" priced at **$349.00**.   - This product is not relevant to the user's request for Joy-Con controllers.   - A product titled \"Bonadget Joypad (L/R) for Nintendo Switch, Gamepad\" is visible, priced at **$24.75**.   - This product may not be an official Nintendo Joy-Con.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Walmart. The goal is to locate an official Nintendo Joy-Con product for price comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Best Buy'}} | Description: This action will open the Best Buy app, allowing me to search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" and note the price for comparison. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to open the Best Buy app, but the screen after the action still shows the Walmart app interface. This indicates that the Best Buy app was not successfully opened, and the user remains on the Walmart app.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to attempt reopening the Best Buy app from the home screen. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Best Buy'}} | Description: This action will open the Best Buy app, allowing me to search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" and note the price for comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 317, 'y': 281, 'text': 'Nintendo Switch Joy-Con'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con,\" and press Enter to initiate the search for the product on the Best Buy app. This will allow me to locate the product and note its price for comparison. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed.   - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo.   - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews.   - Over 2,000 units were bought in the past month.   - The product color is \"Blue and Neon Yellow.\"   - The price of the product on Amazon is **$85.00**.   - Free returns are available.   - Includes a $2.00 Amazon discount.   - Free delivery is estimated between December 28 and January 3, with the fastest delivery option between December 26 and 29.   - The product will arrive after Christmas.  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" in the Walmart app has been initiated.   - The current screen shows search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" (307 results).   - A sponsored product is displayed: \"Nintendo Switch \u2013 OLED Model Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle\" priced at **$349.00**.   - This product is not relevant to the user's request for Joy-Con controllers.   - A product titled \"Bonadget Joypad (L/R) for Nintendo Switch, Gamepad\" is visible, priced at **$24.75**.   - This product may not be an official Nintendo Joy-Con.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Best Buy'}} | Description: This action will open the Best Buy app, allowing me to search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" and note the price for comparison. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to open the Best Buy app, but the screen after the action still shows the Walmart app interface. This indicates that the Best Buy app was not successfully opened, and the user remains on the Walmart app.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to attempt reopening the Best Buy app from the home screen. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Best Buy'}} | Description: This action will open the Best Buy app, allowing me to search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" and note the price for comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 317, 'y': 281, 'text': 'Nintendo Switch Joy-Con'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con,\" and press Enter to initiate the search for the product on the Best Buy app. This will allow me to locate the product and note its price for comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" in the Best Buy app. This will help locate the official product and note its price for comparison. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed.   - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo.   - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews.   - Over 2,000 units were bought in the past month.   - The product color is \"Blue and Neon Yellow.\"   - The price of the product on Amazon is **$85.00**.   - Free returns are available.   - Includes a $2.00 Amazon discount.   - Free delivery is estimated between December 28 and January 3, with the fastest delivery option between December 26 and 29.   - The product will arrive after Christmas.  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" in the Walmart app has been initiated.   - The current screen shows search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" (307 results).   - A sponsored product is displayed: \"Nintendo Switch \u2013 OLED Model Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle\" priced at **$349.00**.   - This product is not relevant to the user's request for Joy-Con controllers.   - A product titled \"Bonadget Joypad (L/R) for Nintendo Switch, Gamepad\" is visible, priced at **$24.75**.   - This product may not be an official Nintendo Joy-Con.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to attempt reopening the Best Buy app from the home screen. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Best Buy'}} | Description: This action will open the Best Buy app, allowing me to search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" and note the price for comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 317, 'y': 281, 'text': 'Nintendo Switch Joy-Con'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con,\" and press Enter to initiate the search for the product on the Best Buy app. This will allow me to locate the product and note its price for comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" in the Best Buy app. This will help locate the official product and note its price for comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to return to the Walmart app where the cheaper Joy-Con pair is available for $71.90. I will then navigate to the product page to stop at the screen where it can be added to the cart. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" on Amazon has been completed.   - A relevant product was identified: \"Nintendo Blue/Neon Yellow Joy-Con (L-R) - Switch\" by Nintendo.   - The product has a rating of 4.7 stars based on 31,648 reviews.   - Over 2,000 units were bought in the past month.   - The product color is \"Blue and Neon Yellow.\"   - The price of the product on Amazon is **$85.00**.   - Free returns are available.   - Includes a $2.00 Amazon discount.   - Free delivery is estimated between December 28 and January 3, with the fastest delivery option between December 26 and 29.   - The product will arrive after Christmas.  - The search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" in the Walmart app has been initiated.   - The current screen shows search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" (307 results).   - A sponsored product is displayed: \"Nintendo Switch \u2013 OLED Model Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle\" priced at **$349.00**.   - This product is not relevant to the user's request for Joy-Con controllers.   - A product titled \"Bonadget Joypad (L/R) for Nintendo Switch, Gamepad\" is visible, priced at **$24.75**.   - This product may not be an official Nintendo Joy-Con.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Best Buy'}} | Description: This action will open the Best Buy app, allowing me to search for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" and note the price for comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 317, 'y': 281, 'text': 'Nintendo Switch Joy-Con'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con,\" and press Enter to initiate the search for the product on the Best Buy app. This will allow me to locate the product and note its price for comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional search results for \"Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\" in the Best Buy app. This will help locate the official product and note its price for comparison. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to return to the Walmart app where the cheaper Joy-Con pair is available for $71.90. I will then navigate to the product page to stop at the screen where it can be added to the cart. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 1030}} | Description: This action will tap on the product listing for the **Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Pair, Neon Pink and Neon Green** priced at $71.90 in the Walmart app. This will navigate to the product page, where I can stop at the screen to add the item to the cart. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expected behavior was to navigate to the product page for the **Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Pair, Neon Pink and Neon Green** priced at $71.90. However, the screen after the action remains on the product listing page, indicating that the tap action did not successfully navigate to the product page.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screen now displays the \"Add to cart\" button, and the subgoal has been completed.\n\n---\nCarefully reflect on the interaction history of the current task. Check if there are any subgoals that are accomplished by a sequence of successful actions and can be consolidated into new \"Shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions. For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",

If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12.

If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.  13. If an app fails to open or navigate correctly, return to the home screen and retry the action. This often resolves navigation issues.  14. If a tap action does not work as expected, consider tapping alternative areas of the screen, such as associated buttons or options, to achieve the desired outcome.  15. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is reopened and verify the screen before proceeding to avoid unnecessary repetition.",
