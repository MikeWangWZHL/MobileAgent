Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.",

The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[95, 42]; text: 5:55\n[161, 432]; text: Settings\n[664, 431]; text: Notes\n[916, 431]; text: Clock\n[413, 432]; text: Contacts\n[913, 758]; text: Gallery\n[161, 757]; text: Chrome\n[665, 756]; text: YouTube\n[413, 759]; text: Google\n[914, 966]; text: m\n[664, 967]; text: 31\n[162, 1084]; text: Maps\n[416, 1085]; text: Gmail\n[664, 1084]; text: Calendar\n[915, 1084]; text: McDonald's\n[161, 1412]; text: Amazon Shopping\n[414, 1410]; text: Walmart\n[663, 1412]; text: Best Buy\n[916, 1412]; text: Tripadvisor\n[663, 1618]; text: 8\n[913, 1618]; text: Booking\n[164, 1613]; text: Lemon8\n[914, 1737]; text: Booking.com\n[415, 1739]; text: X\n[662, 1738]; text: Fandango\n[161, 1737]; text: Lemon8\n[202, 2077]; text: c\n[251, 2271]; text: III\n[852, 2267]; text: <\n[543, 2269]; text: \u25cb\n[870, 2077]; icon: This is an icon.\n[413, 314]; icon: The icon is round with a red background, white outline around the edge, and a person's silhouette inside it.\n[914, 1294]; icon: This is an icon.\n[163, 641]; icon: This is an icon.\n[413, 967]; icon: The app logo, shaped like a circle with rounded corners, features two overlapping \"M\"s colored red on top and green at bottom.\n[664, 967]; icon: The app logo is circle with blue background, white number thirty-one inside it, and red and green lines around outside edge.\n[914, 314]; icon: The app logo is circular with white lines indicating clock hands, bordered by blue on top and black at bottom.\n[413, 1294]; icon: The app logo has seven yellow petals on blue background, forming a circle.\n[413, 641]; icon: This is an icon.\n[663, 315]; icon: The app logo is circular, with red background and white notepad on it.\n[203, 2077]; icon: The app logo is circular with green background, white border and black letter \"C\" inside it.\n[163, 315]; icon: The app logo displays a white gear inside a blue circle with rounded corners.\n[537, 2076]; icon: This is an icon.\n[163, 1293]; icon: The Amazon logo, which appears as a brown smiley face with green lines on its forehead, is enclosed within a white square.\n[914, 640]; icon: This is an icon.\n[163, 967]; icon: The app logo is circular with a white background, featuring a green pin that has blue and red stripes around it.\n[163, 1621]; icon: The icon is round, yellow with black text that reads \"lemon8\".\n[664, 640]; icon: The app logo is a red play button with a white outline, set against a gray background that resembles a circle.\n[663, 1294]; icon: The icon is round, yellow with blue border and has white text inside that says \"Tag\".\n[663, 1621]; icon: The app logo is orange with white text that says \"F\" inside it, enclosed by a black circle.\n[914, 968]; icon: The logo is shaped like two arcs with three legs, colored red on top and yellow at bottom.\n[913, 1620]; icon: The icon is round, blue with white text that says \"Booking\".\n[413, 1620]; icon: The icon is shaped like an \"X\" and is black with a white outline.\n[413, 1622]; icon: The icon is shaped like a letter X, outlined with white lines against a black background.\n[662, 315]; icon: The app logo is a white book with red pages on top, placed against a solid background of bright red.\n[659, 1293]; icon: The icon is shaped like a rectangle with rounded corners, and its background color is yellow.\n[162, 314]; icon: This is an icon.\n[162, 966]; icon: This is an icon.\n[664, 967]; icon: This is an icon.\n[871, 2076]; icon: This is an icon.\n[202, 2076]; icon: This is an icon.\n[964, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[543, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, outlined with a thin black border, filled with grayish-white color inside.\n[160, 1234]; icon: The icon is a square with green stripes on a white background.\n[414, 966]; icon: The Gmail app logo on my home screen has a blue rounded square with white letters \"G\" and \"M\".\n[913, 638]; icon: The icon is shaped like a flower with six petals, all colored white against a pink background.\n[412, 1291]; icon: The icon is shaped like a hexagon with rounded corners, and it has a yellow background with a black outline.\n[539, 2081]; icon: The icon is shaped like two blue speech bubbles overlapping each other, with the top bubble slightly smaller than the bottom one.\n[913, 1294]; icon: The logo for TripAdvisor, which features two white eyes outlined in black on a green background.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Walmart'}} | Description: This action will open the Walmart app, allowing me to search for the items and check if they are on sale. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Walmart'}} | Description: This action will open the Walmart app, allowing me to search for the items and check if they are on sale. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 233, 'y': 326, 'text': 'ribeye steak'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"ribeye steak,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if ribeye steak is on sale. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Walmart'}} | Description: This action will open the Walmart app, allowing me to search for the items and check if they are on sale. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 233, 'y': 326, 'text': 'ribeye steak'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"ribeye steak,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if ribeye steak is on sale. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 399, 'y': 161, 'text': 'fresh oranges'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, clear the previous search term, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if fresh oranges are on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search term entered was \"ribeye steakfresh oranges\" instead of \"fresh oranges.\" This caused the app to display results for a combined query, which is incorrect and does not meet the expectation of searching solely for \"fresh oranges.\"\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Walmart'}} | Description: This action will open the Walmart app, allowing me to search for the items and check if they are on sale. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 233, 'y': 326, 'text': 'ribeye steak'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"ribeye steak,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if ribeye steak is on sale. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 399, 'y': 161, 'text': 'fresh oranges'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, clear the previous search term, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if fresh oranges are on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search term entered was \"ribeye steakfresh oranges\" instead of \"fresh oranges.\" This caused the app to display results for a combined query, which is incorrect and does not meet the expectation of searching solely for \"fresh oranges.\"\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 479, 'y': 162, 'text': 'fresh oranges'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, clear the previous search term, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if fresh oranges are on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search term \"ribeye steakfresh or\" remains in the search bar, and the search results are still related to ribeye steak. The intended action to clear the search bar, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate a new search did not occur. This could be due to the tap not registering correctly on the search bar or the app not responding as expected.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - No information about fresh oranges being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.  - No information about toilet paper being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Walmart'}} | Description: This action will open the Walmart app, allowing me to search for the items and check if they are on sale. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 233, 'y': 326, 'text': 'ribeye steak'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"ribeye steak,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if ribeye steak is on sale. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 399, 'y': 161, 'text': 'fresh oranges'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, clear the previous search term, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if fresh oranges are on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search term entered was \"ribeye steakfresh oranges\" instead of \"fresh oranges.\" This caused the app to display results for a combined query, which is incorrect and does not meet the expectation of searching solely for \"fresh oranges.\"\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 479, 'y': 162, 'text': 'fresh oranges'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, clear the previous search term, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if fresh oranges are on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search term \"ribeye steakfresh or\" remains in the search bar, and the search results are still related to ribeye steak. The intended action to clear the search bar, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate a new search did not occur. This could be due to the tap not registering correctly on the search bar or the app not responding as expected.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 821, 'y': 161}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current text. This should reset the search bar, allowing me to type \"fresh oranges\" correctly in the next step. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - No information about fresh oranges being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.  - No information about toilet paper being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 233, 'y': 326, 'text': 'ribeye steak'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"ribeye steak,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if ribeye steak is on sale. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 399, 'y': 161, 'text': 'fresh oranges'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, clear the previous search term, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if fresh oranges are on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search term entered was \"ribeye steakfresh oranges\" instead of \"fresh oranges.\" This caused the app to display results for a combined query, which is incorrect and does not meet the expectation of searching solely for \"fresh oranges.\"\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 479, 'y': 162, 'text': 'fresh oranges'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, clear the previous search term, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if fresh oranges are on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search term \"ribeye steakfresh or\" remains in the search bar, and the search results are still related to ribeye steak. The intended action to clear the search bar, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate a new search did not occur. This could be due to the tap not registering correctly on the search bar or the app not responding as expected.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 821, 'y': 161}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current text. This should reset the search bar, allowing me to type \"fresh oranges\" correctly in the next step. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 726, 'y': 957}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Close\" button on the pop-up notification, dismissing it and allowing the screen to display the search results for \"fresh oranges\" without obstruction. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98)   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97)  - No information about toilet paper being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 399, 'y': 161, 'text': 'fresh oranges'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, clear the previous search term, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if fresh oranges are on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search term entered was \"ribeye steakfresh oranges\" instead of \"fresh oranges.\" This caused the app to display results for a combined query, which is incorrect and does not meet the expectation of searching solely for \"fresh oranges.\"\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 479, 'y': 162, 'text': 'fresh oranges'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, clear the previous search term, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if fresh oranges are on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search term \"ribeye steakfresh or\" remains in the search bar, and the search results are still related to ribeye steak. The intended action to clear the search bar, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate a new search did not occur. This could be due to the tap not registering correctly on the search bar or the app not responding as expected.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 821, 'y': 161}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current text. This should reset the search bar, allowing me to type \"fresh oranges\" correctly in the next step. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 726, 'y': 957}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Close\" button on the pop-up notification, dismissing it and allowing the screen to display the search results for \"fresh oranges\" without obstruction. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 347, 'y': 160, 'text': 'fresh oranges'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if fresh oranges are on sale. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98)   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97)  - No information about toilet paper being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 479, 'y': 162, 'text': 'fresh oranges'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, clear the previous search term, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if fresh oranges are on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search term \"ribeye steakfresh or\" remains in the search bar, and the search results are still related to ribeye steak. The intended action to clear the search bar, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate a new search did not occur. This could be due to the tap not registering correctly on the search bar or the app not responding as expected.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 821, 'y': 161}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current text. This should reset the search bar, allowing me to type \"fresh oranges\" correctly in the next step. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 726, 'y': 957}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Close\" button on the pop-up notification, dismissing it and allowing the screen to display the search results for \"fresh oranges\" without obstruction. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 347, 'y': 160, 'text': 'fresh oranges'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if fresh oranges are on sale. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[97, 42]; text: 6:03\n[435, 456]; text: All r\n[601, 459]; text: notes\n[989, 822]; text: C\n[539, 1514]; text: No notes\n[537, 1606]; text: Tap the Add button to create a note.\n[544, 2269]; text: O\n[246, 2270]; text: III\n[855, 2271]; text: <\n[931, 2056]; icon: This is an icon.\n[89, 815]; icon: This is an icon.\n[988, 816]; icon: This is an icon.\n[932, 2055]; icon: This is an icon.\n[542, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black border, and has two thin lines crossing each other at the center.\n[539, 455]; icon: The icon is rectangular and has black text on a white background.\n[964, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[927, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[847, 2268]; icon: The arrow icon on the phone screen has a white outline with a blue fill, pointing to the left.\n[215, 42]; icon: The icon is\u5706\u5f62 (round) and\u9ed1\u8272 (black).\n[241, 2269]; icon: The icon has three horizontal lines, each with a slightly different shade of gray or black.\n[144, 42]; icon: The icon is circular, with a white background filled with red outline and two small black dots representing \"6\" and \":\" respectively.\n[540, 1515]; icon: The icon is a square with rounded corners, filled with white or light gray color.\n[97, 42]; icon: The time on the clock is displayed as \"6:03\" with black numbers against a white background, indicating that it's currently six minutes past three o'clock.\n[407, 453]; icon: The icon is a white \"All\" button with rounded rectangle shape on a black background.\n[169, 42]; icon: The icon is circular, with a white heart symbol centered inside a blue ring.\n[994, 42]; icon: The icon on the phone screen has a white outline with black filling, depicting a wireless signal strength indicator.\n[89, 816]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, filled with gray lines on a white background.\n[930, 2053]; icon: The icon is a square with rounded corners, filled with orange-red color and has a white outline.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98)   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97)  - No information about toilet paper being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 821, 'y': 161}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current text. This should reset the search bar, allowing me to type \"fresh oranges\" correctly in the next step. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 726, 'y': 957}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Close\" button on the pop-up notification, dismissing it and allowing the screen to display the search results for \"fresh oranges\" without obstruction. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 347, 'y': 160, 'text': 'fresh oranges'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if fresh oranges are on sale. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98)   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97)  - No information about toilet paper being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 726, 'y': 957}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Close\" button on the pop-up notification, dismissing it and allowing the screen to display the search results for \"fresh oranges\" without obstruction. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 347, 'y': 160, 'text': 'fresh oranges'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if fresh oranges are on sale. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 847, 'y': 2268}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen, allowing me to create a new note to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expectation was to tap the \"Add\" button in the Notes app to create a new note. However, the screen after the action shows the home screen of the device, indicating that the app was exited instead of creating a new note. This could have been caused by an incorrect tap or a misinterpretation of the button's function.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb).

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 347, 'y': 160, 'text': 'fresh oranges'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"fresh oranges,\" and initiate the search in the Walmart app. This will allow me to check if fresh oranges are on sale. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 847, 'y': 2268}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen, allowing me to create a new note to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expectation was to tap the \"Add\" button in the Notes app to create a new note. However, the screen after the action shows the home screen of the device, indicating that the app was exited instead of creating a new note. This could have been caused by an incorrect tap or a misinterpretation of the button's function.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will reopen the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state.

If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has been activated and you can type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98)   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97)  - No information about toilet paper being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 847, 'y': 2268}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen, allowing me to create a new note to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expectation was to tap the \"Add\" button in the Notes app to create a new note. However, the screen after the action shows the home screen of the device, indicating that the app was exited instead of creating a new note. This could have been caused by an incorrect tap or a misinterpretation of the button's function.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will reopen the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 930, 'y': 2055}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button in the bottom-right corner of the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - No information about toilet paper being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 847, 'y': 2268}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen, allowing me to create a new note to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expectation was to tap the \"Add\" button in the Notes app to create a new note.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - No information about toilet paper being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 847, 'y': 2268}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen, allowing me to create a new note to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expectation was to tap the \"Add\" button in the Notes app to create a new note. However, the screen after the action shows the home screen of the device, indicating that the app was exited instead of creating a new note. This could have been caused by an incorrect tap or a misinterpretation of the button's function.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will reopen the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 930, 'y': 2055}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button in the bottom-right corner of the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Type', 'arguments': {'text': '- Ribeye steak: $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb; final cost depends on weight).\\n- Fresh Navel Orange, Each: $0.77 (Rollback from $0.98).\\n- Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: $4.96 (Rollback from $5.97).'}} | Description: This action will type the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges into the new note in the Notes app. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to navigate back to the Walmart app to search for \"toilet paper.\" | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has been activated and you can type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - No information about toilet paper being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will reopen the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 930, 'y': 2055}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button in the bottom-right corner of the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note to record the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Type', 'arguments': {'text': '- Ribeye steak: $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb; final cost depends on weight).\\n- Fresh Navel Orange, Each: $0.77 (Rollback from $0.98).\\n- Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: $4.96 (Rollback from $5.97).'}} | Description: This action will type the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges into the new note in the Notes app. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to navigate back to the Walmart app to search for \"toilet paper.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 887, 'y': 207, 'text': 'toilet paper'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app, type \"toilet paper,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will allow me to check if toilet paper is on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to search for \"toilet paper\" in the Walmart app. However, the screen after the action does not show any search results or changes related to \"toilet paper.\" Instead, it remains on a screen displaying previously noted items (ribeye steak, fresh oranges, etc.). This suggests that the search action did not execute successfully, possibly due to an issue with tapping the search bar or entering the text.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - No information about toilet paper being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

This indicates that the action either switched to the wrong app or failed to execute the intended search in the Walmart app.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - No information about toilet paper being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Type', 'arguments': {'text': '- Ribeye steak: $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb; final cost depends on weight).\\n- Fresh Navel Orange, Each: $0.77 (Rollback from $0.98).\\n- Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: $4.96 (Rollback from $5.97).'}} | Description: This action will type the sale prices of ribeye steak and fresh oranges into the new note in the Notes app. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to navigate back to the Walmart app to search for \"toilet paper.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 887, 'y': 207, 'text': 'toilet paper'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app, type \"toilet paper,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will allow me to check if toilet paper is on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to search for \"toilet paper\" in the Walmart app. However, the screen after the action does not show any search results or changes related to \"toilet paper.\" Instead, it remains on a screen displaying previously noted items (ribeye steak, fresh oranges, etc.). This suggests that the search action did not execute successfully, possibly due to an issue with tapping the search bar or entering the text.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 887, 'y': 207, 'text': 'toilet paper'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app, type \"toilet paper,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will allow me to check if toilet paper is on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to search for \"toilet paper\" in the Walmart app. However, the resulting screen shows a file manager interface (\"Select items\") instead of the Walmart app's search results. This indicates that the action either switched to the wrong app or failed to execute the intended search in the Walmart app.\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to locate and switch back to the Walmart app to continue the search for \"toilet paper.\" | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - No information about toilet paper being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to navigate back to the Walmart app to search for \"toilet paper.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 887, 'y': 207, 'text': 'toilet paper'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app, type \"toilet paper,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will allow me to check if toilet paper is on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to search for \"toilet paper\" in the Walmart app. However, the screen after the action does not show any search results or changes related to \"toilet paper.\" Instead, it remains on a screen displaying previously noted items (ribeye steak, fresh oranges, etc.).

However, the screen after the action shows the app switcher interface instead of the Walmart app. This indicates that the tap action did not successfully interact with the Walmart app's search bar, likely because the tap was performed outside the app's active area or the app was not properly focused.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - No information about toilet paper being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 887, 'y': 207, 'text': 'toilet paper'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app, type \"toilet paper,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will allow me to check if toilet paper is on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to search for \"toilet paper\" in the Walmart app. However, the screen after the action does not show any search results or changes related to \"toilet paper.\" Instead, it remains on a screen displaying previously noted items (ribeye steak, fresh oranges, etc.). This suggests that the search action did not execute successfully, possibly due to an issue with tapping the search bar or entering the text.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 887, 'y': 207, 'text': 'toilet paper'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app, type \"toilet paper,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will allow me to check if toilet paper is on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to search for \"toilet paper\" in the Walmart app. However, the resulting screen shows a file manager interface (\"Select items\") instead of the Walmart app's search results. This indicates that the action either switched to the wrong app or failed to execute the intended search in the Walmart app.\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to locate and switch back to the Walmart app to continue the search for \"toilet paper.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 887, 'y': 207}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app to activate it, allowing me to type \"toilet paper\" and search for it. This is the first step in retrying the search. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to tap the search bar in the Walmart app to activate it. However, the screen after the action shows the app switcher interface instead of the Walmart app. This indicates that the tap action did not successfully interact with the Walmart app's search bar, likely because the tap was performed outside the app's active area or the app was not properly focused.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Walmart'}} | Description: This action will open the Walmart app from the home screen, ensuring it is properly focused and ready for the search for \"toilet paper.\" | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - No information about toilet paper being on sale is visible in the current screenshot.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 887, 'y': 207, 'text': 'toilet paper'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app, type \"toilet paper,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will allow me to check if toilet paper is on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to search for \"toilet paper\" in the Walmart app. However, the resulting screen shows a file manager interface (\"Select items\") instead of the Walmart app's search results. This indicates that the action either switched to the wrong app or failed to execute the intended search in the Walmart app.\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to locate and switch back to the Walmart app to continue the search for \"toilet paper.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 887, 'y': 207}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app to activate it, allowing me to type \"toilet paper\" and search for it. This is the first step in retrying the search. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to tap the search bar in the Walmart app to activate it. However, the screen after the action shows the app switcher interface instead of the Walmart app. This indicates that the tap action did not successfully interact with the Walmart app's search bar, likely because the tap was performed outside the app's active area or the app was not properly focused.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Walmart'}} | Description: This action will open the Walmart app from the home screen, ensuring it is properly focused and ready for the search for \"toilet paper.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 412, 'y': 161, 'text': 'toilet paper'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app, type \"toilet paper,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will allow me to check if toilet paper is on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query entered was \"fresh orangestoilet paper\" instead of \"toilet paper.\" This resulted in a mixed search result that includes both \"fresh oranges\" and \"toilet paper,\" which is not the intended outcome. The error likely occurred due to a failure to clear the previous search term before entering the new one.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb).

If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to locate and switch back to the Walmart app to continue the search for \"toilet paper.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 887, 'y': 207}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app to activate it, allowing me to type \"toilet paper\" and search for it. This is the first step in retrying the search. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to tap the search bar in the Walmart app to activate it. However, the screen after the action shows the app switcher interface instead of the Walmart app. This indicates that the tap action did not successfully interact with the Walmart app's search bar, likely because the tap was performed outside the app's active area or the app was not properly focused.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Walmart'}} | Description: This action will open the Walmart app from the home screen, ensuring it is properly focused and ready for the search for \"toilet paper.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 412, 'y': 161, 'text': 'toilet paper'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app, type \"toilet paper,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will allow me to check if toilet paper is on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query entered was \"fresh orangestoilet paper\" instead of \"toilet paper.\" This resulted in a mixed search result that includes both \"fresh oranges\" and \"toilet paper,\" which is not the intended outcome. The error likely occurred due to a failure to clear the previous search term before entering the new one.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 821, 'y': 161}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" button in the search bar to clear the current search term. This will allow me to re-enter the correct search term, \"toilet paper,\" in the next step. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 887, 'y': 207}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app to activate it, allowing me to type \"toilet paper\" and search for it. This is the first step in retrying the search. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to tap the search bar in the Walmart app to activate it. However, the screen after the action shows the app switcher interface instead of the Walmart app. This indicates that the tap action did not successfully interact with the Walmart app's search bar, likely because the tap was performed outside the app's active area or the app was not properly focused.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Walmart'}} | Description: This action will open the Walmart app from the home screen, ensuring it is properly focused and ready for the search for \"toilet paper.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 412, 'y': 161, 'text': 'toilet paper'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app, type \"toilet paper,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will allow me to check if toilet paper is on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query entered was \"fresh orangestoilet paper\" instead of \"toilet paper.\" This resulted in a mixed search result that includes both \"fresh oranges\" and \"toilet paper,\" which is not the intended outcome. The error likely occurred due to a failure to clear the previous search term before entering the new one.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 821, 'y': 161}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" button in the search bar to clear the current search term. This will allow me to re-enter the correct search term, \"toilet paper,\" in the next step. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Walmart'}} | Description: This action will open the Walmart app from the home screen, ensuring it is properly focused and ready for the search for \"toilet paper.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 412, 'y': 161, 'text': 'toilet paper'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app, type \"toilet paper,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will allow me to check if toilet paper is on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query entered was \"fresh orangestoilet paper\" instead of \"toilet paper.\" This resulted in a mixed search result that includes both \"fresh oranges\" and \"toilet paper,\" which is not the intended outcome. The error likely occurred due to a failure to clear the previous search term before entering the new one.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 821, 'y': 161}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" button in the search bar to clear the current search term. This will allow me to re-enter the correct search term, \"toilet paper,\" in the next step. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app from the home screen, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, the screen now displays a file management interface with options like \"Internal storage,\" \"SD card,\" and \"Download.\" This indicates that the wrong app was opened, possibly due to a misclick or incorrect app selection.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 412, 'y': 161, 'text': 'toilet paper'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Walmart app, type \"toilet paper,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will allow me to check if toilet paper is on sale. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query entered was \"fresh orangestoilet paper\" instead of \"toilet paper.\" This resulted in a mixed search result that includes both \"fresh oranges\" and \"toilet paper,\" which is not the intended outcome. The error likely occurred due to a failure to clear the previous search term before entering the new one.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 821, 'y': 161}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" button in the search bar to clear the current search term. This will allow me to re-enter the correct search term, \"toilet paper,\" in the next step. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app from the home screen, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, the screen now displays a file management interface with options like \"Internal storage,\" \"SD card,\" and \"Download.\" This indicates that the wrong app was opened, possibly due to a misclick or incorrect app selection.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 821, 'y': 161}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" button in the search bar to clear the current search term. This will allow me to re-enter the correct search term, \"toilet paper,\" in the next step. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app from the home screen, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, the screen now displays a file management interface with options like \"Internal storage,\" \"SD card,\" and \"Download.\" This indicates that the wrong app was opened, possibly due to a misclick or incorrect app selection.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap on the Notes app icon at the specified coordinates to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file manager or storage-related app. This indicates that the tap action was either misaligned or the Notes app icon was not correctly identified.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app from the home screen, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, the screen now displays a file management interface with options like \"Internal storage,\" \"SD card,\" and \"Download.\" This indicates that the wrong app was opened, possibly due to a misclick or incorrect app selection.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap on the Notes app icon at the specified coordinates to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file manager or storage-related app. This indicates that the tap action was either misaligned or the Notes app icon was not correctly identified.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app from the home screen, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, the screen now displays a file management interface with options like \"Internal storage,\" \"SD card,\" and \"Download.\" This indicates that the wrong app was opened, possibly due to a misclick or incorrect app selection.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap on the Notes app icon at the specified coordinates to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file manager or storage-related app. This indicates that the tap action was either misaligned or the Notes app icon was not correctly identified.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap on the Notes app icon at the specified coordinates to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file management interface (likely a file explorer). This indicates that the tap action did not correctly target the Notes app icon, possibly due to a misalignment in the tap coordinates.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap on the Notes app icon at the specified coordinates to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file manager or storage-related app. This indicates that the tap action was either misaligned or the Notes app icon was not correctly identified.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap on the Notes app icon at the specified coordinates to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file management interface (likely a file explorer). This indicates that the tap action did not correctly target the Notes app icon, possibly due to a misalignment in the tap coordinates.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap on the Notes app icon at the specified coordinates to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file manager or storage-related app. This indicates that the tap action was either misaligned or the Notes app icon was not correctly identified.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap on the Notes app icon at the specified coordinates to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file management interface (likely a file explorer). This indicates that the tap action did not correctly target the Notes app icon, possibly due to a misalignment in the tap coordinates.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 420}} | Description: This action will tap slightly above the previous coordinates to correctly target the Notes app and open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file manager or storage-related app. This indicates that the tap coordinates were incorrect, targeting an unintended app.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Note the price if applicable. 4. Search for \"toilet paper\" in the Walmart app and check if it is on sale. Note the price if applicable. 5. Open the Notes app and record the sale prices of the items (if any).\n\n### Progress Status ###\nThe home screen was successfully accessed. The Notes app is visible and ready to be opened to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. Proceed to open the Notes app and record the information.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nOpen the Notes app and record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper.\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone. Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content).

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap on the Notes app icon at the specified coordinates to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file management interface (likely a file explorer). This indicates that the tap action did not correctly target the Notes app icon, possibly due to a misalignment in the tap coordinates.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 420}} | Description: This action will tap slightly above the previous coordinates to correctly target the Notes app and open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file manager or storage-related app. This indicates that the tap coordinates were incorrect, targeting an unintended app.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap on the Notes app icon at the specified coordinates to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action was intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file management interface (likely a file explorer). This indicates that the tap action did not correctly target the Notes app icon, possibly due to a misalignment in the tap coordinates.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 420}} | Description: This action will tap slightly above the previous coordinates to correctly target the Notes app and open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file manager or storage-related app. This indicates that the tap coordinates were incorrect, targeting an unintended app.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 450}} | Description: This action will tap slightly below the previous coordinates to correctly target the Notes app and open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file management app or a similar interface showing \"Select items\" and storage options. This indicates that the tap was not accurately targeted at the Notes app icon.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 420}} | Description: This action will tap slightly above the previous coordinates to correctly target the Notes app and open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file manager or storage-related app. This indicates that the tap coordinates were incorrect, targeting an unintended app.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 450}} | Description: This action will tap slightly below the previous coordinates to correctly target the Notes app and open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file management app or a similar interface showing \"Select items\" and storage options. This indicates that the tap was not accurately targeted at the Notes app icon.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to correctly locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 420}} | Description: This action will tap slightly above the previous coordinates to correctly target the Notes app and open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file manager or storage-related app. This indicates that the tap coordinates were incorrect, targeting an unintended app.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 450}} | Description: This action will tap slightly below the previous coordinates to correctly target the Notes app and open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file management app or a similar interface showing \"Select items\" and storage options. This indicates that the tap was not accurately targeted at the Notes app icon.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to correctly locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap directly on the Notes app icon to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app by tapping on its icon. However, the resulting screen shows a file management interface (\"Select items\"), which is unrelated to the Notes app. This indicates that the wrong app was opened, possibly due to an incorrect tap or misidentification of the Notes app icon.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Note the price if applicable. 4. Search for \"toilet paper\" in the Walmart app and check if it is on sale. Note the price if applicable. 5. Open the Notes app and record the sale prices of the items (if any).\n\n### Progress Status ###\nThe home screen was successfully accessed. The Notes app is visible and ready to be opened to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. Proceed to open the Notes app and record the information.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nOpen the Notes app and record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper.\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone. Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[97, 43]; text: 6:23\n[664, 430]; text: Notes\n[160, 431]; text: Settings\n[413, 430]; text: Contacts\n[917, 431]; text: Clock\n[914, 758]; text: Gallery\n[161, 757]; text: Chrome\n[665, 756]; text: YouTube\n[413, 759]; text: Google\n[915, 966]; text: m\n[664, 967]; text: 31\n[161, 1085]; text: Maps\n[415, 1085]; text: Gmail\n[666, 1084]; text: Calendar\n[915, 1084]; text: McDonald's\n[914, 1302]; text: 00\n[664, 1411]; text: Best Buy\n[161, 1412]; text: Amazon Shopping\n[918, 1412]; text: Tripadvisor\n[415, 1413]; text: Walmart\n[663, 1619]; text: 8\n[913, 1620]; text: Booking\n[162, 1614]; text: Lemon8\n[914, 1738]; text: Booking.com\n[414, 1740]; text: X\n[663, 1739]; text: Fandango\n[163, 1740]; text: Lemon8\n[202, 2077]; text: c\n[251, 2271]; text: III\n[852, 2267]; text: <\n[543, 2269]; text: \u25cb\n[870, 2077]; icon: The app logo is circular with a pink background, white border, and black camera graphic at its center.\n[413, 313]; icon: This is an icon.\n[413, 1294]; icon: The app logo has six petals, all yellow with blue shading at their tips.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and correctly open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 450}} | Description: This action will tap slightly below the previous coordinates to correctly target the Notes app and open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file management app or a similar interface showing \"Select items\" and storage options. This indicates that the tap was not accurately targeted at the Notes app icon.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to correctly locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap directly on the Notes app icon to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app by tapping on its icon. However, the resulting screen shows a file management interface (\"Select items\"), which is unrelated to the Notes app. This indicates that the wrong app was opened, possibly due to an incorrect tap or misidentification of the Notes app icon.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to correctly locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 450}} | Description: This action will tap slightly below the previous coordinates to correctly target the Notes app and open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file management app or a similar interface showing \"Select items\" and storage options. This indicates that the tap was not accurately targeted at the Notes app icon.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to correctly locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap directly on the Notes app icon to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app by tapping on its icon. However, the resulting screen shows a file management interface (\"Select items\"), which is unrelated to the Notes app. This indicates that the wrong app was opened, possibly due to an incorrect tap or misidentification of the Notes app icon.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to correctly locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 420}} | Description: This action will tap slightly above the center of the Notes app icon to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file management interface (likely a file explorer). This indicates that the tap was either misaligned or the Notes app icon was not correctly targeted.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to correctly locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap directly on the Notes app icon to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app by tapping on its icon. However, the resulting screen shows a file management interface (\"Select items\"), which is unrelated to the Notes app. This indicates that the wrong app was opened, possibly due to an incorrect tap or misidentification of the Notes app icon.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to correctly locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 420}} | Description: This action will tap slightly above the center of the Notes app icon to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file management interface (likely a file explorer). This indicates that the tap was either misaligned or the Notes app icon was not correctly targeted.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to correctly locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 430}} | Description: This action will tap directly on the Notes app icon to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app by tapping on its icon. However, the resulting screen shows a file management interface (\"Select items\"), which is unrelated to the Notes app. This indicates that the wrong app was opened, possibly due to an incorrect tap or misidentification of the Notes app icon.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to correctly locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 420}} | Description: This action will tap slightly above the center of the Notes app icon to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file management interface (likely a file explorer). This indicates that the tap was either misaligned or the Notes app icon was not correctly targeted.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to correctly locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 450}} | Description: This action will tap slightly below the Notes app icon to ensure the correct app is opened. The expected outcome is that the Notes app will open, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file manager or storage-related app. This indicates that the tap was not accurately placed on the Notes app icon, possibly due to a slight misalignment in the tap coordinates.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8. When using sliders for filters (e.g., price range), swiping is often more effective than tapping to adjust the values.  9. If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12. If swiping to reveal content, ensure the swipe is smooth and covers enough distance to load all relevant details on the screen.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Ribeye steak is on sale at Walmart for $25.07 (average price $15.97/lb). Final cost depends on weight.  - Fresh oranges are on sale at Walmart:   - Fresh Navel Orange, Each: **$0.77** (Rollback from $0.98).   - Fresh Navel Oranges, 4 lb Bag: **$4.96** (Rollback from $5.97).  - Toilet paper is on sale at Walmart:   - Charmin Ultra Soft, 12 Mega XL Rolls: **$19.96**.   - Mega Rolls, 30-pack: **$25.98** (34.0\u00a2/100 ct).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Swipe_to_Reveal_Content(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2) to reveal additional content below or above on the screen. | Precondition: The screen contains content that can be revealed by swiping.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to correctly locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 420}} | Description: This action will tap slightly above the center of the Notes app icon to open it, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file management interface (likely a file explorer). This indicates that the tap was either misaligned or the Notes app icon was not correctly targeted.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to correctly locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 450}} | Description: This action will tap slightly below the Notes app icon to ensure the correct app is opened. The expected outcome is that the Notes app will open, allowing me to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to open the Notes app, but instead, it opened a file manager or storage-related app. This indicates that the tap was not accurately placed on the Notes app icon, possibly due to a slight misalignment in the tap coordinates.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to correctly locate and open the Notes app to record the sale prices of ribeye steak, fresh oranges, and toilet paper. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.  7. If a filter does not apply correctly, try adjusting it again by swiping or tapping alternative areas of the screen to reveal hidden options.  8.

If a filter unexpectedly resets or removes itself, reapply it and verify the results before proceeding.  10. Always double-check the final results to ensure all filters (e.g., price, specifications) have been applied correctly.  11. When comparing prices across platforms, ensure that the product model and specifications (e.g., size, features) are identical to avoid inaccurate comparisons.  12.
