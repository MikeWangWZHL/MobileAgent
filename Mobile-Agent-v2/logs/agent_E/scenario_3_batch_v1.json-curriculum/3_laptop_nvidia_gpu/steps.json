Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 161, 'y': 1412}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to proceed with searching for a laptop that meets the specified criteria. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"laptops with Nvidia GPU\" has been successfully performed. - The current results include:  1. **ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)** Gaming Laptop:   - Price: $1,268.83 (List price: $1,399.99)   - RAM and GPU details are not visible in the screenshot.  2. **Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop** (Overall Pick):   - Features: Intel Core i7-13620H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050.   - RAM details are not visible in the screenshot. - Filters for price under $1000 and RAM above 8GB still need to be applied.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 161, 'y': 1412}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to proceed with searching for a laptop that meets the specified criteria. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'laptops with Nvidia GPU'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"laptops with Nvidia GPU,\" and initiate the search, allowing me to proceed with filtering the results based on the user's criteria. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"laptops with Nvidia GPU\" has been successfully performed.  - The current results include:   1. **ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)** Gaming Laptop:    - Price: $1,268.83 (List price: $1,399.99)    - RAM and GPU details are not visible in the screenshot.   2. **Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop** (Overall Pick):    - Features: Intel Core i7-13620H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050.    - RAM details are not visible in the screenshot.  - Filters for price under $1000 and RAM above 8GB still need to be applied.  - The \"Filters\" button was successfully tapped, and the filter options are now visible.  - The price range filter currently shows a range of $68\u2013$7,800+.  - The \"Show 2,282 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results before applying additional filters.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 161, 'y': 1412}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to proceed with searching for a laptop that meets the specified criteria. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'laptops with Nvidia GPU'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"laptops with Nvidia GPU,\" and initiate the search, allowing me to proceed with filtering the results based on the user's criteria. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 152, 'y': 438}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Filters\" button, opening the filter options so I can set the price range to under $1000 and RAM to more than 8GB. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"laptops with Nvidia GPU\" has been successfully performed.  - The current results include:   1. **ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)** Gaming Laptop:    - Price: $1,268.83 (List price: $1,399.99)    - RAM and GPU details are not visible in the screenshot.   2. **Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop** (Overall Pick):    - Features: Intel Core i7-13620H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050.    - RAM details are not visible in the screenshot.  - Filters for price under $1000 and RAM above 8GB still need to be applied.  - The \"Filters\" button was successfully tapped, and the filter options are now visible.  - The price range filter currently shows a range of $68\u2013$7,800+.  - The \"Show 2,282 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results before applying additional filters.  - The \"Prime\" filter is toggled on.  - The \"Price\" filter is visible and ready to be adjusted.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 161, 'y': 1412}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to proceed with searching for a laptop that meets the specified criteria. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'laptops with Nvidia GPU'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"laptops with Nvidia GPU,\" and initiate the search, allowing me to proceed with filtering the results based on the user's criteria. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 152, 'y': 438}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Filters\" button, opening the filter options so I can set the price range to under $1000 and RAM to more than 8GB. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 234, 'y': 1897}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Price\" filter, allowing me to adjust the price range to under $1000. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"laptops with Nvidia GPU\" has been successfully performed.  - The current results include:   1. **ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)** Gaming Laptop:    - Price: $1,268.83 (List price: $1,399.99)    - RAM and GPU details are not visible in the screenshot.   2. **Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop** (Overall Pick):    - Features: Intel Core i7-13620H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050.    - RAM details are not visible in the screenshot.  - Filters for price under $1000 and RAM above 8GB still need to be applied.  - The \"Filters\" button was successfully tapped, and the filter options are now visible.  - The price range filter currently shows a range of $68\u2013$7,800+.  - The \"Show 2,282 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results before applying additional filters.  - The \"Prime\" filter is toggled on.  - The \"Price\" filter is visible and ready to be adjusted.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 161, 'y': 1412}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to proceed with searching for a laptop that meets the specified criteria. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'laptops with Nvidia GPU'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"laptops with Nvidia GPU,\" and initiate the search, allowing me to proceed with filtering the results based on the user's criteria. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 152, 'y': 438}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Filters\" button, opening the filter options so I can set the price range to under $1000 and RAM to more than 8GB. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 234, 'y': 1897}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Price\" filter, allowing me to adjust the price range to under $1000. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 234, 'y': 1897}} | Description: This action will tap on the price range area to open the interface for adjusting the price range, allowing me to set it to under $1000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping on the price range area did not result in any visible change. The interface for adjusting the price range did not open, and the screen remains the same as before the action.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Here are some logs:\n- Attempt: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 234, 'y': 1897}} | Description: This action will tap on the price range area to open the interface for adjusting the price range, allowing me to set it to under $1000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping on the price range area did not result in any visible change. The interface for adjusting the price range did not open, and the screen remains the same as before the action.\n- Attempt: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 1897}} | Description: This action will tap on the center of the price range area to open the interface for adjusting the price range, allowing me to set it to under $1000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping on the price range area did not result in any visible change. The interface for adjusting the price range did not open, and the screen remains the same as before the action.\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded. The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here. Otherwise, keep the current plan and copy it here.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nThe next subgoal to work on. If the previous subgoal is not yet complete, copy it here. If all subgoals are completed, write \"Finished\".\n",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"laptops with Nvidia GPU\" has been successfully performed.  - The current results include:   1. **ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)** Gaming Laptop:    - Price: $1,268.83 (List price: $1,399.99)    - RAM and GPU details are not visible in the screenshot.   2. **Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop** (Overall Pick):    - Features: Intel Core i7-13620H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050.    - RAM details are not visible in the screenshot.  - Filters for price under $1000 and RAM above 8GB still need to be applied.  - The \"Filters\" button was successfully tapped, and the filter options are now visible.  - The price range filter currently shows a range of $68\u2013$7,800+.  - The \"Show 2,282 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results before applying additional filters.  - The \"Prime\" filter is toggled on.  - The \"Price\" filter is visible and ready to be adjusted.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'laptops with Nvidia GPU'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"laptops with Nvidia GPU,\" and initiate the search, allowing me to proceed with filtering the results based on the user's criteria. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 152, 'y': 438}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Filters\" button, opening the filter options so I can set the price range to under $1000 and RAM to more than 8GB. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 234, 'y': 1897}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Price\" filter, allowing me to adjust the price range to under $1000. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 234, 'y': 1897}} | Description: This action will tap on the price range area to open the interface for adjusting the price range, allowing me to set it to under $1000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping on the price range area did not result in any visible change. The interface for adjusting the price range did not open, and the screen remains the same as before the action.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 1897}} | Description: This action will tap on the center of the price range area to open the interface for adjusting the price range, allowing me to set it to under $1000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping on the price range area did not result in any visible change. The interface for adjusting the price range did not open, and the screen remains the same as before the action.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 152, 'y': 438}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Filters\" button, opening the filter options so I can set the price range to under $1000 and RAM to more than 8GB. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 234, 'y': 1897}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Price\" filter, allowing me to adjust the price range to under $1000. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 234, 'y': 1897}} | Description: This action will tap on the price range area to open the interface for adjusting the price range, allowing me to set it to under $1000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping on the price range area did not result in any visible change. The interface for adjusting the price range did not open, and the screen remains the same as before the action.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 1897}} | Description: This action will tap on the center of the price range area to open the interface for adjusting the price range, allowing me to set it to under $1000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping on the price range area did not result in any visible change. The interface for adjusting the price range did not open, and the screen remains the same as before the action.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, potentially uncovering additional controls or options for adjusting the price range. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"laptops with Nvidia GPU\" has been successfully performed.  - The current results include:   1. **ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)** Gaming Laptop:    - Price: $1,268.83 (List price: $1,399.99)    - RAM and GPU details are not visible in the screenshot.   2. **Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop** (Overall Pick):    - Features: Intel Core i7-13620H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050.    - RAM details are not visible in the screenshot.  - Filters for price under $1000 and RAM above 8GB still need to be applied.  - The \"Filters\" button was successfully tapped, and the filter options are now visible.  - The \"Price\" filter currently shows a range of $68\u2013$1,350.  - The \"Show 1,322 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results before applying additional filters.  - The \"Prime\" filter is toggled on.  - The \"Price\" filter is visible and ready to be adjusted.  - The \"Graphics Coprocessor\" filter includes options for NVIDIA GPUs such as:   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660Ti  - The \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter is visible but not yet applied.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 234, 'y': 1897}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Price\" filter, allowing me to adjust the price range to under $1000. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 234, 'y': 1897}} | Description: This action will tap on the price range area to open the interface for adjusting the price range, allowing me to set it to under $1000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping on the price range area did not result in any visible change. The interface for adjusting the price range did not open, and the screen remains the same as before the action.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 1897}} | Description: This action will tap on the center of the price range area to open the interface for adjusting the price range, allowing me to set it to under $1000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping on the price range area did not result in any visible change. The interface for adjusting the price range did not open, and the screen remains the same as before the action.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, potentially uncovering additional controls or options for adjusting the price range. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 948, 'y1': 846, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 846}} | Description: This action will swipe the right circle of the price slider to the left, reducing the maximum price to $1000. This should update the price range filter accordingly. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"laptops with Nvidia GPU\" has been successfully performed.  - The current results include:   1. **ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)** Gaming Laptop:    - Price: $1,268.83 (List price: $1,399.99)    - RAM and GPU details are not visible in the screenshot.   2. **Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop** (Overall Pick):    - Features: Intel Core i7-13620H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050.    - RAM details are not visible in the screenshot.  - Filters for price under $1000 and RAM above 8GB still need to be applied.  - The \"Filters\" button was successfully tapped, and the filter options are now visible.  - The \"Price\" filter currently shows a range of $68\u2013$1,350.  - The \"Show 1,322 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results before applying additional filters.  - The \"Prime\" filter is toggled on.  - The \"Price\" filter is visible and ready to be adjusted.  - The \"Graphics Coprocessor\" filter includes options for NVIDIA GPUs such as:   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660Ti  - The \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter is visible and has been applied to **16 GB**.  - Options for RAM include:   - 64 GB   - 32 GB   - 16 GB (selected)   - 8 GB   - 4 GB  - The \"Customer Reviews\" filter is visible with the option \"& Up\" (4 stars and above).  - The \"Computer Processor Type\" filter includes options such as:   - AMD Ryzen 5, 7, 9   - Intel Core i5, i7, i9   - Intel Celeron, Pentium.  - The \"Show 574 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results after applying the RAM filter.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 1897}} | Description: This action will tap on the center of the price range area to open the interface for adjusting the price range, allowing me to set it to under $1000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping on the price range area did not result in any visible change. The interface for adjusting the price range did not open, and the screen remains the same as before the action.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, potentially uncovering additional controls or options for adjusting the price range. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 948, 'y1': 846, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 846}} | Description: This action will swipe the right circle of the price slider to the left, reducing the maximum price to $1000. This should update the price range filter accordingly. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, potentially uncovering the \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter. This will allow me to apply the filter for laptops with more than 8GB of RAM. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 474, 'y': 1151}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"16 GB\" option under the \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter, applying the filter for laptops with more than 8GB of RAM. This will narrow down the search results further. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"laptops with Nvidia GPU\" has been successfully performed.  - The current results include:   1. **ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)** Gaming Laptop:    - Price: $1,268.83 (List price: $1,399.99)    - RAM and GPU details are not visible in the screenshot.   2. **Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop** (Overall Pick):    - Features: Intel Core i7-13620H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050.    - RAM details are not visible in the screenshot.  - Filters for price under $1000 and RAM above 8GB still need to be applied.  - The \"Filters\" button was successfully tapped, and the filter options are now visible.  - The \"Price\" filter currently shows a range of $68\u2013$1,350.  - The \"Show 1,322 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results before applying additional filters.  - The \"Prime\" filter is toggled on.  - The \"Price\" filter is visible and ready to be adjusted.  - The \"Graphics Coprocessor\" filter includes options for NVIDIA GPUs such as:   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660Ti  - The \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter is visible and has been applied to **16 GB**.  - Options for RAM include:   - 64 GB   - 32 GB   - 16 GB (selected)   - 8 GB   - 4 GB  - The \"Customer Reviews\" filter is visible with the option \"& Up\" (4 stars and above).  - The \"Computer Processor Type\" filter includes options such as:   - AMD Ryzen 5, 7, 9   - Intel Core i5, i7, i9   - Intel Celeron, Pentium.  - The \"Show 574 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results after applying the RAM filter.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, potentially uncovering additional controls or options for adjusting the price range. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 948, 'y1': 846, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 846}} | Description: This action will swipe the right circle of the price slider to the left, reducing the maximum price to $1000. This should update the price range filter accordingly. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, potentially uncovering the \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter. This will allow me to apply the filter for laptops with more than 8GB of RAM. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 474, 'y': 1151}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"16 GB\" option under the \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter, applying the filter for laptops with more than 8GB of RAM. This will narrow down the search results further. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 853, 'y': 2102}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Show 574 results\" button to display the laptops that meet the applied filters, including a price under $1000, an Nvidia GPU, and more than 8GB of RAM. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expectation was to display laptops under $1000 with an Nvidia GPU and more than 8GB of RAM. However, the results shown include laptops priced above $1000, such as the ASUS ROG Strix G16 listed at $1,268.83. This indicates that the price filter was not correctly applied to limit results to under $1000.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 948, 'y1': 846, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 846}} | Description: This action will swipe the right circle of the price slider to the left, reducing the maximum price to $1000. This should update the price range filter accordingly. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, potentially uncovering the \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter. This will allow me to apply the filter for laptops with more than 8GB of RAM. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 474, 'y': 1151}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"16 GB\" option under the \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter, applying the filter for laptops with more than 8GB of RAM. This will narrow down the search results further. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 853, 'y': 2102}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Show 574 results\" button to display the laptops that meet the applied filters, including a price under $1000, an Nvidia GPU, and more than 8GB of RAM. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expectation was to display laptops under $1000 with an Nvidia GPU and more than 8GB of RAM. However, the results shown include laptops priced above $1000, such as the ASUS ROG Strix G16 listed at $1,268.83. This indicates that the price filter was not correctly applied to limit results to under $1000.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 119, 'y': 438}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Filters\" button to open the filter settings, allowing me to adjust the price filter to set the maximum price to $1,000. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"laptops with Nvidia GPU\" has been successfully performed.  - The current results include:   1. **ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)** Gaming Laptop:    - Price: $1,268.83 (List price: $1,399.99)    - RAM and GPU details are not visible in the screenshot.   2. **Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop** (Overall Pick):    - Features: Intel Core i7-13620H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050.    - RAM details are not visible in the screenshot.  - Filters for price under $1000 and RAM above 8GB still need to be applied.  - The \"Filters\" button was successfully tapped, and the filter options are now visible.  - The \"Price\" filter currently shows a range of $68\u2013$1,350.  - The \"Show 1,322 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results before applying additional filters.  - The \"Prime\" filter is toggled on.  - The \"Price\" filter is visible and ready to be adjusted.  - The \"Graphics Coprocessor\" filter includes options for NVIDIA GPUs such as:   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660Ti  - The \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter is visible and has been applied to **16 GB**.  - Options for RAM include:   - 64 GB   - 32 GB   - 16 GB (selected)   - 8 GB   - 4 GB  - The \"Customer Reviews\" filter is visible with the option \"& Up\" (4 stars and above).  - The \"Computer Processor Type\" filter includes options such as:   - AMD Ryzen 5, 7, 9   - Intel Core i5, i7, i9   - Intel Celeron, Pentium.  - The \"Show 574 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results after applying the RAM filter.  - The \"Prime Programs\" filter is toggled on.  - Sellers include:   - Cardinal Pro Electronics   - Amazon.com   - Amazon Resale   - Delca Electronics   - Happy Ranger   - Store_Wolf   - younworldwide.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, potentially uncovering the \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter. This will allow me to apply the filter for laptops with more than 8GB of RAM. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 474, 'y': 1151}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"16 GB\" option under the \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter, applying the filter for laptops with more than 8GB of RAM. This will narrow down the search results further. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 853, 'y': 2102}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Show 574 results\" button to display the laptops that meet the applied filters, including a price under $1000, an Nvidia GPU, and more than 8GB of RAM. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expectation was to display laptops under $1000 with an Nvidia GPU and more than 8GB of RAM. However, the results shown include laptops priced above $1000, such as the ASUS ROG Strix G16 listed at $1,268.83. This indicates that the price filter was not correctly applied to limit results to under $1000.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 119, 'y': 438}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Filters\" button to open the filter settings, allowing me to adjust the price filter to set the maximum price to $1,000. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 207, 'y': 589}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Up to $1,350\" filter to open the price adjustment settings, allowing me to set the maximum price to $1,000. This will ensure that only laptops priced under $1,000 are included in the results. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expectation was that tapping on the \"Up to $1,350\" filter would open the price adjustment settings to allow setting the maximum price to $1,000. However, after the action, the \"Up to $1,350\" filter was removed entirely, and no price adjustment settings were opened. This indicates that the action did not meet the intended goal.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly.

These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"laptops with Nvidia GPU\" has been successfully performed.  - The current results include:   1. **ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)** Gaming Laptop:    - Price: $1,268.83 (List price: $1,399.99)    - RAM and GPU details are not visible in the screenshot.   2. **Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop** (Overall Pick):    - Features: Intel Core i7-13620H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050.    - RAM details are not visible in the screenshot.  - Filters for price under $1000 and RAM above 8GB still need to be applied.  - The \"Filters\" button was successfully tapped, and the filter options are now visible.  - The \"Price\" filter currently shows a range of $68\u2013$1,350.  - The \"Show 1,322 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results before applying additional filters.  - The \"Prime\" filter is toggled on.  - The \"Price\" filter is visible and ready to be adjusted.  - The \"Graphics Coprocessor\" filter includes options for NVIDIA GPUs such as:   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660Ti  - The \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter is visible and has been applied to **16 GB**.  - Options for RAM include:   - 64 GB   - 32 GB   - 16 GB (selected)   - 8 GB   - 4 GB  - The \"Customer Reviews\" filter is visible with the option \"& Up\" (4 stars and above).  - The \"Computer Processor Type\" filter includes options such as:   - AMD Ryzen 5, 7, 9   - Intel Core i5, i7, i9   - Intel Celeron, Pentium.  - The \"Show 574 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results after applying the RAM filter.  - The \"Prime Programs\" filter is toggled on.  - Sellers include:   - Cardinal Pro Electronics   - Amazon.com   - Amazon Resale   - Delca Electronics   - Happy Ranger   - Store_Wolf   - younworldwide.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 474, 'y': 1151}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"16 GB\" option under the \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter, applying the filter for laptops with more than 8GB of RAM. This will narrow down the search results further. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 853, 'y': 2102}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Show 574 results\" button to display the laptops that meet the applied filters, including a price under $1000, an Nvidia GPU, and more than 8GB of RAM. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expectation was to display laptops under $1000 with an Nvidia GPU and more than 8GB of RAM. However, the results shown include laptops priced above $1000, such as the ASUS ROG Strix G16 listed at $1,268.83. This indicates that the price filter was not correctly applied to limit results to under $1000.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 119, 'y': 438}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Filters\" button to open the filter settings, allowing me to adjust the price filter to set the maximum price to $1,000. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 207, 'y': 589}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Up to $1,350\" filter to open the price adjustment settings, allowing me to set the maximum price to $1,000. This will ensure that only laptops priced under $1,000 are included in the results. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expectation was that tapping on the \"Up to $1,350\" filter would open the price adjustment settings to allow setting the maximum price to $1,000. However, after the action, the \"Up to $1,350\" filter was removed entirely, and no price adjustment settings were opened. This indicates that the action did not meet the intended goal.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 65, 'y': 1971}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Price\" section to expand it, allowing access to the price adjustment settings where the maximum price can be set to $1,000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Price\" section was expected to expand after the tap action, allowing access to the price adjustment settings. However, there is no visible change in the screen content, and the \"Price\" section remains collapsed.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"laptops with Nvidia GPU\" has been successfully performed.  - The current results include:   1. **ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)** Gaming Laptop:    - Price: $1,268.83 (List price: $1,399.99)    - RAM and GPU details are not visible in the screenshot.   2. **Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop** (Overall Pick):    - Features: Intel Core i7-13620H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050.    - RAM details are not visible in the screenshot.  - Filters for price under $1000 and RAM above 8GB still need to be applied.  - The \"Filters\" button was successfully tapped, and the filter options are now visible.  - The \"Price\" filter currently shows a range of $135\u2013$2,700+.  - The \"Show 699 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results before applying additional filters.  - The \"Prime\" filter is toggled on.  - The \"Graphics Coprocessor\" filter includes options for NVIDIA GPUs such as:   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650   - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060   - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050  - The \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter is visible and has been applied to **16 GB**.  - Options for RAM include:   - 64 GB   - 32 GB   - 16 GB (selected)   - 8 GB   - 4 GB  - The \"Customer Reviews\" filter is visible with the option \"& Up\" (4 stars and above).  - The \"Computer Processor Type\" filter includes options such as:   - AMD Ryzen 5, 7, 9   - Intel Core i5, i7, i9   - Intel Celeron, Pentium.  - The \"Prime Programs\" filter is toggled on.  - Sellers include:   - Cardinal Pro Electronics   - Amazon.com   - Amazon Resale   - Delca Electronics   - Happy Ranger   - Store_Wolf   - younworldwide.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 853, 'y': 2102}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Show 574 results\" button to display the laptops that meet the applied filters, including a price under $1000, an Nvidia GPU, and more than 8GB of RAM. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expectation was to display laptops under $1000 with an Nvidia GPU and more than 8GB of RAM. However, the results shown include laptops priced above $1000, such as the ASUS ROG Strix G16 listed at $1,268.83. This indicates that the price filter was not correctly applied to limit results to under $1000.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 119, 'y': 438}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Filters\" button to open the filter settings, allowing me to adjust the price filter to set the maximum price to $1,000. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 207, 'y': 589}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Up to $1,350\" filter to open the price adjustment settings, allowing me to set the maximum price to $1,000. This will ensure that only laptops priced under $1,000 are included in the results. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expectation was that tapping on the \"Up to $1,350\" filter would open the price adjustment settings to allow setting the maximum price to $1,000. However, after the action, the \"Up to $1,350\" filter was removed entirely, and no price adjustment settings were opened. This indicates that the action did not meet the intended goal.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 65, 'y': 1971}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Price\" section to expand it, allowing access to the price adjustment settings where the maximum price can be set to $1,000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Price\" section was expected to expand after the tap action, allowing access to the price adjustment settings. However, there is no visible change in the screen content, and the \"Price\" section remains collapsed.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional content below, potentially exposing the price adjustment settings where the maximum price can be set to $1,000. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"laptops with Nvidia GPU\" has been successfully performed.  - The current results include:   1. **ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)** Gaming Laptop:    - Price: $1,268.83 (List price: $1,399.99)    - RAM and GPU details are not visible in the screenshot.   2. **Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop** (Overall Pick):    - Features: Intel Core i7-13620H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050.    - RAM details are not visible in the screenshot.  - Filters for price under $1000 and RAM above 8GB still need to be applied.  - The \"Filters\" button was successfully tapped, and the filter options are now visible.  - The \"Price\" filter currently shows a range of $135\u2013$2,700+.  - The \"Show 699 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results before applying additional filters.  - The \"Prime\" filter is toggled on.  - The \"Graphics Coprocessor\" filter includes options for NVIDIA GPUs such as:   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650   - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060   - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050  - The \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter is visible and has been applied to **16 GB**.  - Options for RAM include:   - 64 GB   - 32 GB   - 16 GB (selected)   - 8 GB   - 4 GB  - The \"Customer Reviews\" filter is visible with the option \"& Up\" (4 stars and above).  - The \"Computer Processor Type\" filter includes options such as:   - AMD Ryzen 5, 7, 9   - Intel Core i5, i7, i9   - Intel Celeron, Pentium.  - The \"Prime Programs\" filter is toggled on.  - Sellers include:   - Cardinal Pro Electronics   - Amazon.com   - Amazon Resale   - Delca Electronics   - Happy Ranger   - Store_Wolf   - younworldwide.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 119, 'y': 438}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Filters\" button to open the filter settings, allowing me to adjust the price filter to set the maximum price to $1,000. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 207, 'y': 589}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Up to $1,350\" filter to open the price adjustment settings, allowing me to set the maximum price to $1,000. This will ensure that only laptops priced under $1,000 are included in the results. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expectation was that tapping on the \"Up to $1,350\" filter would open the price adjustment settings to allow setting the maximum price to $1,000. However, after the action, the \"Up to $1,350\" filter was removed entirely, and no price adjustment settings were opened. This indicates that the action did not meet the intended goal.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 65, 'y': 1971}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Price\" section to expand it, allowing access to the price adjustment settings where the maximum price can be set to $1,000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Price\" section was expected to expand after the tap action, allowing access to the price adjustment settings. However, there is no visible change in the screen content, and the \"Price\" section remains collapsed.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional content below, potentially exposing the price adjustment settings where the maximum price can be set to $1,000. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 948, 'y': 1045}} | Description: This action will tap on the right circle of the price slider to attempt to adjust the maximum price. This should allow me to set the maximum price to $1,000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping on the right circle of the price slider did not result in any visible change to the maximum price filter. The price range remains \"$135 - $2,700+\" as it was before the action. This suggests that the tap action alone was insufficient to adjust the slider.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"laptops with Nvidia GPU\" has been successfully performed.  - The current results include:   1. **ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)** Gaming Laptop:    - Price: $1,268.83 (List price: $1,399.99)    - RAM and GPU details are not visible in the screenshot.   2. **Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop** (Overall Pick):    - Features: Intel Core i7-13620H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050.    - RAM details are not visible in the screenshot.  - Filters for price under $1000 and RAM above 8GB still need to be applied.  - The \"Filters\" button was successfully tapped, and the filter options are now visible.  - The \"Price\" filter currently shows a range of $135\u2013$960.  - The \"Show 391 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results after applying the price filter.  - The \"Prime\" filter is toggled on.  - The \"Graphics Coprocessor\" filter includes options for NVIDIA GPUs such as:   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650   - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050   - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060  - The \"Notebook Computer RAM Memory Size\" filter is visible and has been applied to **16 GB**.  - Options for RAM include:   - 64 GB   - 32 GB   - 16 GB (selected)   - 8 GB   - 4 GB  - The \"Customer Reviews\" filter is visible with the option \"& Up\" (4 stars and above).  - The \"Computer Processor Type\" filter includes options such as:   - AMD Ryzen 5, 7, 9   - Intel Core i5, i7, i9   - Intel Celeron, Pentium.  - The \"Prime Programs\" filter is toggled on.  - Sellers include:   - Cardinal Pro Electronics   - Amazon.com   - Amazon Resale   - Delca Electronics   - Happy Ranger   - Store_Wolf   - younworldwide.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 207, 'y': 589}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Up to $1,350\" filter to open the price adjustment settings, allowing me to set the maximum price to $1,000. This will ensure that only laptops priced under $1,000 are included in the results. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expectation was that tapping on the \"Up to $1,350\" filter would open the price adjustment settings to allow setting the maximum price to $1,000. However, after the action, the \"Up to $1,350\" filter was removed entirely, and no price adjustment settings were opened. This indicates that the action did not meet the intended goal.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 65, 'y': 1971}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Price\" section to expand it, allowing access to the price adjustment settings where the maximum price can be set to $1,000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Price\" section was expected to expand after the tap action, allowing access to the price adjustment settings. However, there is no visible change in the screen content, and the \"Price\" section remains collapsed.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional content below, potentially exposing the price adjustment settings where the maximum price can be set to $1,000. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 948, 'y': 1045}} | Description: This action will tap on the right circle of the price slider to attempt to adjust the maximum price. This should allow me to set the maximum price to $1,000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping on the right circle of the price slider did not result in any visible change to the maximum price filter. The price range remains \"$135 - $2,700+\" as it was before the action. This suggests that the tap action alone was insufficient to adjust the slider.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 948, 'y1': 1045, 'x2': 700, 'y2': 1045}} | Description: This action will swipe the right circle of the price slider to the left, reducing the maximum price. The goal is to adjust the price range to under $1,000. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"laptops with Nvidia GPU\" has been successfully performed.  - The current results include:   1. **ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)** Gaming Laptop:    - Price: $1,268.83 (List price: $1,399.99)    - RAM and GPU details are not visible in the screenshot.   2. **Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop** (Overall Pick):    - Features: Intel Core i7-13620H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050.    - RAM details are not visible in the screenshot.  - Filters applied:   - Price range: **$560\u2013$960**   - Graphics Coprocessor: **NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650**   - RAM: **16 GB**  - The \"Show 27 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results after applying the filters.  - The \"Prime\" filter is toggled on.  - Sellers include:   - Cardinal Pro Electronics   - Amazon.com   - Amazon Resale   - Delca Electronics   - Happy Ranger   - Store_Wolf   - younworldwide.  - Additional Graphics Coprocessor options available:   - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050   - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060  - The \"Customer Reviews\" filter is visible with the option \"& Up\" (4 stars and above).  - The \"Computer Processor Type\" filter includes options such as:   - AMD Ryzen 5, 7, 9   - Intel Core i5, i7, i9   - Intel Celeron, Pentium.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 65, 'y': 1971}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Price\" section to expand it, allowing access to the price adjustment settings where the maximum price can be set to $1,000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Price\" section was expected to expand after the tap action, allowing access to the price adjustment settings. However, there is no visible change in the screen content, and the \"Price\" section remains collapsed.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional content below, potentially exposing the price adjustment settings where the maximum price can be set to $1,000. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 948, 'y': 1045}} | Description: This action will tap on the right circle of the price slider to attempt to adjust the maximum price. This should allow me to set the maximum price to $1,000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping on the right circle of the price slider did not result in any visible change to the maximum price filter. The price range remains \"$135 - $2,700+\" as it was before the action. This suggests that the tap action alone was insufficient to adjust the slider.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 948, 'y1': 1045, 'x2': 700, 'y2': 1045}} | Description: This action will swipe the right circle of the price slider to the left, reducing the maximum price. The goal is to adjust the price range to under $1,000. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 724, 'y': 1760}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\" option under the \"Graphics Coprocessor\" filter. This will ensure that only laptops with this specific NVIDIA GPU are included in the results. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the best deal, prioritize both price and features, and ensure any discounts or promotions are clearly noted.  5. Always confirm that the displayed product matches the search criteria (e.g., size, specifications) to avoid selecting an incorrect item.  6. If the task requires stopping at a specific screen, ensure the screen is fully loaded and all relevant details are visible before stopping.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"laptops with Nvidia GPU\" has been successfully performed.  - The current results include:   1. **ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)** Gaming Laptop:    - Price: $1,268.83 (List price: $1,399.99)    - RAM and GPU details are not visible in the screenshot.   2. **Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop** (Overall Pick):    - Features: Intel Core i7-13620H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050.    - RAM details are not visible in the screenshot.   3. **HP 2022 Victus Gaming Laptop**:    - Features: 15.6-Inch 144Hz FHD Display, 12th Gen Core i5-12450H, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650.    - RAM: 16 GB.    - Price: Not visible in the screenshot.    - Customer Rating: 4.2/5 (258 reviews).  - Filters applied:   - Price range: **$560\u2013$960**   - Graphics Coprocessor: **NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650**   - RAM: **16 GB**  - The \"Show 27 results\" button is visible, indicating the number of results after applying the filters.  - The \"Prime\" filter is toggled on.  - Sellers include:   - Cardinal Pro Electronics   - Amazon.com   - Amazon Resale   - Delca Electronics   - Happy Ranger   - Store_Wolf   - younworldwide.  - Additional Graphics Coprocessor options available:   - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050   - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060  - The \"Customer Reviews\" filter is visible with the option \"& Up\" (4 stars and above).  - The \"Computer Processor Type\" filter includes options such as:   - AMD Ryzen 5, 7, 9   - Intel Core i5, i7, i9   - Intel Celeron, Pentium.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional content below, potentially exposing the price adjustment settings where the maximum price can be set to $1,000. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 948, 'y': 1045}} | Description: This action will tap on the right circle of the price slider to attempt to adjust the maximum price. This should allow me to set the maximum price to $1,000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping on the right circle of the price slider did not result in any visible change to the maximum price filter. The price range remains \"$135 - $2,700+\" as it was before the action. This suggests that the tap action alone was insufficient to adjust the slider.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 948, 'y1': 1045, 'x2': 700, 'y2': 1045}} | Description: This action will swipe the right circle of the price slider to the left, reducing the maximum price. The goal is to adjust the price range to under $1,000. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 724, 'y': 1760}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\" option under the \"Graphics Coprocessor\" filter. This will ensure that only laptops with this specific NVIDIA GPU are included in the results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 865, 'y': 2103}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Show 27 results\" button to display the filtered list of laptops. This will allow me to review the options and identify a suitable laptop under $1,000 with an NVIDIA GPU and more than 8GB of RAM. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Stop at the screen displaying the best deal you find.\n- Check if any of the following items are on sale at Walmart: ribeye steak, fresh oranges, or toilet paper. If any are on sale, add a note in Notes with their prices.\n- I want to buy a brand-new Nintendo Switch Joy-Con. Any color is fine. Please compare the prices on Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy. Find the cheapest option and stop at the screen where I can add it to the cart.\n\n---\nCarefully reflect on the interaction history of the current task. Check if there are any subgoals that are accomplished by a sequence of successful actions and can be consolidated into new \"Shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions. For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",

This indicates that the action did not meet the intended goal.\n- Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 65, 'y': 1971}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Price\" section to expand it, allowing access to the price adjustment settings where the maximum price can be set to $1,000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Price\" section was expected to expand after the tap action, allowing access to the price adjustment settings. However, there is no visible change in the screen content, and the \"Price\" section remains collapsed.\n- Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional content below, potentially exposing the price adjustment settings where the maximum price can be set to $1,000. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The price adjustment settings have been revealed. You can now proceed to adjust the maximum price to $1,000.\n- Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 948, 'y': 1045}} | Description: This action will tap on the right circle of the price slider to attempt to adjust the maximum price. This should allow me to set the maximum price to $1,000. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping on the right circle of the price slider did not result in any visible change to the maximum price filter. The price range remains \"$135 - $2,700+\" as it was before the action. This suggests that the tap action alone was insufficient to adjust the slider.\n- Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 948, 'y1': 1045, 'x2': 700, 'y2': 1045}} | Description: This action will swipe the right circle of the price slider to the left, reducing the maximum price. The goal is to adjust the price range to under $1,000. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The price filter has been successfully adjusted to set the maximum price to $1,000. You can now proceed to the next step of finding a laptop with an Nvidia GPU and more than 8GB of RAM.\n- Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 724, 'y': 1760}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\" option under the \"Graphics Coprocessor\" filter. This will ensure that only laptops with this specific NVIDIA GPU are included in the results. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The \"NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\" filter has been successfully applied, reducing the results to 27 laptops. You can now proceed to review the results to identify a laptop that meets the remaining criteria.\n- Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 865, 'y': 2103}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Show 27 results\" button to display the filtered list of laptops. This will allow me to review the options and identify a suitable laptop under $1,000 with an NVIDIA GPU and more than 8GB of RAM. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The filtered list of laptops has been displayed. You can now proceed to review the results to identify a laptop that meets the criteria of being under $1,000, having an NVIDIA GPU, and more than 8GB of RAM.\n- Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 739, 'y': 1834}} | Description: This action will tap on the HP 2022 Victus Gaming Laptop listing to open its product page and check the price and other details to confirm if it meets the criteria. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The HP 2022 Victus Gaming Laptop meets the criteria: - Price: Under $1,000 ($419.58). - GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650. - RAM: 16GB. Details of the laptop have been noted. You can proceed to finalize the selection or explore other options if needed.\n\n---\n### Future Tasks ###\nHere are some tasks that you might be asked to do in the future:\n- Compare the price of a Ninja air fryer 8 qt at Walmart and Amazon.
