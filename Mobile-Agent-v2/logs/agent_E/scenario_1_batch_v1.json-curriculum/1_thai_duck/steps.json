If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: This action will open the Google Maps app, allowing me to search for Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed. - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: This action will open the Google Maps app, allowing me to search for Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Thai restaurant Urbana IL'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL,\" and execute the search to display relevant results for Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed.  - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.  - The \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace was successfully tapped, leading to a page with multiple ordering options.  - Ordering platforms available: **Menufy**, **DoorDash**, **EatStreet**, **Seamless**, **Grubhub**, and **Caviar**.  - Menufy is marked as \"Preferred by business.\"  - Service fees and preparation times vary by platform.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: This action will open the Google Maps app, allowing me to search for Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Thai restaurant Urbana IL'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL,\" and execute the search to display relevant results for Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 575, 'y': 1859}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace, which may provide access to the menu or ordering options to confirm if duck dishes are available. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed.  - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.  - The \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace was successfully tapped, leading to a page with multiple ordering options.  - Ordering platforms available: **Menufy**, **DoorDash**, **EatStreet**, **Seamless**, **Grubhub**, and **Caviar**.  - Menufy is marked as \"Preferred by business.\"  - Service fees and preparation times vary by platform.  - The Menufy platform was accessed to explore the menu.  - Siam Terrace's address: **212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801**.  - Phone number: **(217) 367-8424**.  - Opening hours: **Noon - 9:00 PM**.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: This action will open the Google Maps app, allowing me to search for Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Thai restaurant Urbana IL'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL,\" and execute the search to display relevant results for Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 575, 'y': 1859}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace, which may provide access to the menu or ordering options to confirm if duck dishes are available. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 231, 'y': 737}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Menufy\" option to access the menu for Siam Terrace and check if duck dishes are available. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed.  - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.  - The \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace was successfully tapped, leading to a page with multiple ordering options.  - Ordering platforms available: **Menufy**, **DoorDash**, **EatStreet**, **Seamless**, **Grubhub**, and **Caviar**.  - Menufy is marked as \"Preferred by business.\"  - Service fees and preparation times vary by platform.  - The Menufy platform was accessed to explore the menu.  - Siam Terrace's address: **212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801**.  - Phone number: **(217) 367-8424**.  - Opening hours: **Noon - 9:00 PM**.  - The menu categories visible on Menufy include **APPETIZERS** and **SOUP**.  - The next step is to continue exploring the menu to confirm if duck dishes are available.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: This action will open the Google Maps app, allowing me to search for Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Thai restaurant Urbana IL'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL,\" and execute the search to display relevant results for Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 575, 'y': 1859}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace, which may provide access to the menu or ordering options to confirm if duck dishes are available. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 231, 'y': 737}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Menufy\" option to access the menu for Siam Terrace and check if duck dishes are available. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, potentially displaying the menu or options to explore the menu further. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed.  - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.  - The \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace was successfully tapped, leading to a page with multiple ordering options.  - Ordering platforms available: **Menufy**, **DoorDash**, **EatStreet**, **Seamless**, **Grubhub**, and **Caviar**.  - Menufy is marked as \"Preferred by business.\"  - Service fees and preparation times vary by platform.  - The Menufy platform was accessed to explore the menu.  - Siam Terrace's address: **212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801**.  - Phone number: **(217) 367-8424**.  - Opening hours: **Noon - 9:00 PM**.  - The menu categories visible on Menufy include **APPETIZERS** and **SOUP**.  - The \"APPETIZERS\" section includes:   - A1.

To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Thai restaurant Urbana IL'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL,\" and execute the search to display relevant results for Thai restaurants in Urbana, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 575, 'y': 1859}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace, which may provide access to the menu or ordering options to confirm if duck dishes are available. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 231, 'y': 737}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Menufy\" option to access the menu for Siam Terrace and check if duck dishes are available. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, potentially displaying the menu or options to explore the menu further. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more of the menu, allowing me to check for duck dishes in other sections. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed.  - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.  - The \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace was successfully tapped, leading to a page with multiple ordering options.  - Ordering platforms available: **Menufy**, **DoorDash**, **EatStreet**, **Seamless**, **Grubhub**, and **Caviar**.  - Menufy is marked as \"Preferred by business.\"  - Service fees and preparation times vary by platform.  - The Menufy platform was accessed to explore the menu.  - Siam Terrace's address: **212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801**.  - Phone number: **(217) 367-8424**.  - Opening hours: **Noon - 9:00 PM**.  - The menu categories visible on Menufy include **APPETIZERS**, **SOUP**, and **SALAD**.  - The \"APPETIZERS\" section includes:   - A1.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed.  - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.  - The \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace was successfully tapped, leading to a page with multiple ordering options.  - Ordering platforms available: **Menufy**, **DoorDash**, **EatStreet**, **Seamless**, **Grubhub**, and **Caviar**.  - Menufy is marked as \"Preferred by business.\"  - Service fees and preparation times vary by platform.  - Siam Terrace's address: **212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801**.  - Phone number: **(217) 367-8424**.  - Opening hours: **Noon - 9:00 PM**.  - The menu categories visible on Menufy include **APPETIZERS**, **SOUP**, and **SALAD**.  - The \"APPETIZERS\" section includes:   - A1.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 231, 'y': 737}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Menufy\" option to access the menu for Siam Terrace and check if duck dishes are available. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, potentially displaying the menu or options to explore the menu further. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more of the menu, allowing me to check for duck dishes in other sections. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 706, 'y': 325}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"SOUP\" section at the top of the menu, switching to that category to check if duck dishes are available. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 588, 'y': 327}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"SALAD\" section at the top of the menu, switching to that category to check if duck dishes are available. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed.  - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.  - The \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace was successfully tapped, leading to a page with multiple ordering options.  - Ordering platforms available: **Menufy**, **DoorDash**, **EatStreet**, **Seamless**, **Grubhub**, and **Caviar**.  - Menufy is marked as \"Preferred by business.\"  - Service fees and preparation times vary by platform.  - Siam Terrace's address: **212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801**.  - Phone number: **(217) 367-8424**.  - Opening hours: **Noon - 9:00 PM**.  - The menu categories visible on Menufy include **APPETIZERS**, **SOUP**, and **SALAD**.  - The \"APPETIZERS\" section includes:   - A1.

Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more content, potentially displaying the menu or options to explore the menu further. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more of the menu, allowing me to check for duck dishes in other sections. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 706, 'y': 325}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"SOUP\" section at the top of the menu, switching to that category to check if duck dishes are available. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 588, 'y': 327}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"SALAD\" section at the top of the menu, switching to that category to check if duck dishes are available. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 718, 'y': 326}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"SIAM TERRACE'S F\" section at the top of the menu to explore additional menu items and check for duck dishes. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed.  - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.  - The \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace was successfully tapped, leading to a page with multiple ordering options.  - Ordering platforms available: **Menufy**, **DoorDash**, **EatStreet**, **Seamless**, **Grubhub**, and **Caviar**.  - Menufy is marked as \"Preferred by business.\"  - Service fees and preparation times vary by platform.  - Siam Terrace's address: **212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801**.  - Phone number: **(217) 367-8424**.  - Opening hours: **Noon - 9:00 PM**.  - The menu categories visible on Menufy include **APPETIZERS**, **SOUP**, **SALAD**, and **SIAM TERRACE'S HOUSE SPECIALS**.  - The \"APPETIZERS\" section includes:   - A1.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more of the menu, allowing me to check for duck dishes in other sections. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 706, 'y': 325}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"SOUP\" section at the top of the menu, switching to that category to check if duck dishes are available. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 588, 'y': 327}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"SALAD\" section at the top of the menu, switching to that category to check if duck dishes are available. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 718, 'y': 326}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"SIAM TERRACE'S F\" section at the top of the menu to explore additional menu items and check for duck dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional menu sections or items, allowing me to continue searching for duck dishes. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them.

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed.  - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.  - The \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace was successfully tapped, leading to a page with multiple ordering options.  - Ordering platforms available: **Menufy**, **DoorDash**, **EatStreet**, **Seamless**, **Grubhub**, and **Caviar**.  - Menufy is marked as \"Preferred by business.\"  - Service fees and preparation times vary by platform.  - Siam Terrace's address: **212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801**.  - Phone number: **(217) 367-8424**.  - Opening hours: **Noon - 9:00 PM**.  - The menu categories visible on Menufy include **APPETIZERS**, **SOUP**, **SALAD**, and **SIAM TERRACE'S HOUSE SPECIALS**.  - The \"APPETIZERS\" section includes:   - A1.

The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 588, 'y': 327}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"SALAD\" section at the top of the menu, switching to that category to check if duck dishes are available. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 718, 'y': 326}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"SIAM TERRACE'S F\" section at the top of the menu to explore additional menu items and check for duck dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional menu sections or items, allowing me to continue searching for duck dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more menu sections or items, allowing me to continue searching for duck dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will navigate back to the previous screen, likely the main page for Siam Terrace on Google Maps, where customer reviews can be accessed. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Back\" action navigated to a page related to online ordering options for Siam Terrace instead of the main page on Google Maps where customer reviews can be accessed. This indicates that the action did not return to the expected screen for reviewing customer feedback.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed.  - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.  - The \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace was successfully tapped, leading to a page with multiple ordering options.  - Ordering platforms available: **Menufy**, **DoorDash**, **EatStreet**, **Seamless**, **Grubhub**, and **Caviar**.  - Menufy is marked as \"Preferred by business.\"  - Service fees and preparation times vary by platform.  - Siam Terrace's address: **212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801**.  - Phone number: **(217) 367-8424**.  - Opening hours: **Noon - 9:00 PM**.  - The menu categories visible on Menufy include **APPETIZERS**, **SOUP**, **SALAD**, and **SIAM TERRACE'S HOUSE SPECIALS**.  - The \"APPETIZERS\" section includes:   - A1.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 718, 'y': 326}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"SIAM TERRACE'S F\" section at the top of the menu to explore additional menu items and check for duck dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional menu sections or items, allowing me to continue searching for duck dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more menu sections or items, allowing me to continue searching for duck dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will navigate back to the previous screen, likely the main page for Siam Terrace on Google Maps, where customer reviews can be accessed. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Back\" action navigated to a page related to online ordering options for Siam Terrace instead of the main page on Google Maps where customer reviews can be accessed. This indicates that the action did not return to the expected screen for reviewing customer feedback.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 66, 'y': 157}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" button at the top left of the screen to close the current ordering page and return to the main Google Maps page for Siam Terrace, where customer reviews can be accessed. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed.  - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.  - The \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace was successfully tapped, leading to a page with multiple ordering options.  - Ordering platforms available: **Menufy**, **DoorDash**, **EatStreet**, **Seamless**, **Grubhub**, and **Caviar**.  - Menufy is marked as \"Preferred by business.\"  - Service fees and preparation times vary by platform.  - Siam Terrace's address: **212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801**.  - Phone number: **(217) 367-8424**.  - Opening hours: **Noon - 9:00 PM**.  - The menu categories visible on Menufy include **APPETIZERS**, **SOUP**, **SALAD**, and **SIAM TERRACE'S HOUSE SPECIALS**.  - The \"APPETIZERS\" section includes:   - A1.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional menu sections or items, allowing me to continue searching for duck dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more menu sections or items, allowing me to continue searching for duck dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will navigate back to the previous screen, likely the main page for Siam Terrace on Google Maps, where customer reviews can be accessed. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Back\" action navigated to a page related to online ordering options for Siam Terrace instead of the main page on Google Maps where customer reviews can be accessed. This indicates that the action did not return to the expected screen for reviewing customer feedback.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 66, 'y': 157}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" button at the top left of the screen to close the current ordering page and return to the main Google Maps page for Siam Terrace, where customer reviews can be accessed. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional content, including customer reviews for Siam Terrace. This is necessary to access and summarize the feedback. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed.  - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.  - The \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace was successfully tapped, leading to a page with multiple ordering options.  - Ordering platforms available: **Menufy**, **DoorDash**, **EatStreet**, **Seamless**, **Grubhub**, and **Caviar**.  - Menufy is marked as \"Preferred by business.\"  - Service fees and preparation times vary by platform.  - Siam Terrace's address: **212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801**.  - Phone number: **(217) 367-8424**.  - Opening hours: **Noon - 9:00 PM**.  - The menu categories visible on Menufy include **APPETIZERS**, **SOUP**, **SALAD**, and **SIAM TERRACE'S HOUSE SPECIALS**.  - The \"APPETIZERS\" section includes:   - A1.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal more menu sections or items, allowing me to continue searching for duck dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will navigate back to the previous screen, likely the main page for Siam Terrace on Google Maps, where customer reviews can be accessed. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Back\" action navigated to a page related to online ordering options for Siam Terrace instead of the main page on Google Maps where customer reviews can be accessed. This indicates that the action did not return to the expected screen for reviewing customer feedback.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 66, 'y': 157}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" button at the top left of the screen to close the current ordering page and return to the main Google Maps page for Siam Terrace, where customer reviews can be accessed. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional content, including customer reviews for Siam Terrace. This is necessary to access and summarize the feedback. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 207, 'y': 751}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Siam Terrace\" section to open its detailed page, where customer reviews can be accessed for summarization. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed.  - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.  - The \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace was successfully tapped, leading to a page with multiple ordering options.  - Ordering platforms available: **Menufy**, **DoorDash**, **EatStreet**, **Seamless**, **Grubhub**, and **Caviar**.  - Menufy is marked as \"Preferred by business.\"  - Service fees and preparation times vary by platform.  - Siam Terrace's address: **212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801**.  - Phone number: **(217) 367-8424**.  - Opening hours: **Noon - 9:00 PM**.  - The menu categories visible on Menufy include **APPETIZERS**, **SOUP**, **SALAD**, and **SIAM TERRACE'S HOUSE SPECIALS**.  - The \"APPETIZERS\" section includes:   - A1.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will navigate back to the previous screen, likely the main page for Siam Terrace on Google Maps, where customer reviews can be accessed. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Back\" action navigated to a page related to online ordering options for Siam Terrace instead of the main page on Google Maps where customer reviews can be accessed. This indicates that the action did not return to the expected screen for reviewing customer feedback.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 66, 'y': 157}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" button at the top left of the screen to close the current ordering page and return to the main Google Maps page for Siam Terrace, where customer reviews can be accessed. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional content, including customer reviews for Siam Terrace. This is necessary to access and summarize the feedback. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 207, 'y': 751}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Siam Terrace\" section to open its detailed page, where customer reviews can be accessed for summarization. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 585, 'y': 1584}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Reviews\" tab to open the customer reviews section for Siam Terrace, enabling the collection of positive and negative feedback. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed.  - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.  - The \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace was successfully tapped, leading to a page with multiple ordering options.  - Ordering platforms available: **Menufy**, **DoorDash**, **EatStreet**, **Seamless**, **Grubhub**, and **Caviar**.  - Menufy is marked as \"Preferred by business.\"  - Service fees and preparation times vary by platform.  - Siam Terrace's address: **212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801**.  - Phone number: **(217) 367-8424**.  - Opening hours: **Noon - 9:00 PM**.  - The menu categories visible on Menufy include **APPETIZERS**, **SOUP**, **SALAD**, and **SIAM TERRACE'S HOUSE SPECIALS**.  - The \"APPETIZERS\" section includes:   - A1.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up on the screen to reveal additional content, including customer reviews for Siam Terrace. This is necessary to access and summarize the feedback. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 207, 'y': 751}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Siam Terrace\" section to open its detailed page, where customer reviews can be accessed for summarization. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 585, 'y': 1584}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Reviews\" tab to open the customer reviews section for Siam Terrace, enabling the collection of positive and negative feedback. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing access to the Notes app to record the summarized feedback. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to document the summary of customer feedback for Siam Terrace. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Thai restaurant Urbana IL\" has been executed.  - **Siam Terrace** is a Thai restaurant in Urbana, IL, with a rating of **4.5\u2605 (587 reviews)**.  - Price range: **$10\u201320**.  - Description: \"No-frills restaurant dishing up Thai standards alongside sushi & other Japanese fare.\"  - Status: **Open** (Closes at 9 PM).  - Distance: **1.3 miles** from the current location.  - The \"Order\" button for Siam Terrace was successfully tapped, leading to a page with multiple ordering options.  - Ordering platforms available: **Menufy**, **DoorDash**, **EatStreet**, **Seamless**, **Grubhub**, and **Caviar**.  - Menufy is marked as \"Preferred by business.\"  - Service fees and preparation times vary by platform.  - Siam Terrace's address: **212 W Main Street, Urbana, IL 61801**.  - Phone number: **(217) 367-8424**.  - Opening hours: **Noon - 9:00 PM**.  - The menu categories visible on Menufy include **APPETIZERS**, **SOUP**, **SALAD**, and **SIAM TERRACE'S HOUSE SPECIALS**.  - The \"APPETIZERS\" section includes:   - A1.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 207, 'y': 751}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Siam Terrace\" section to open its detailed page, where customer reviews can be accessed for summarization. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 585, 'y': 1584}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Reviews\" tab to open the customer reviews section for Siam Terrace, enabling the collection of positive and negative feedback. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing access to the Notes app to record the summarized feedback. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to document the summary of customer feedback for Siam Terrace. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 932, 'y': 2055}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button in the Notes app, enabling the creation of a new note where I can document the feedback summary. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Find the phone number and create a new note in Notes for that.\n- Find me a popular Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport on Google Maps. Check X for recent posts about their signature dishes and write a summary in Notes. Then get directions to that restaurant on Google Maps. Stop at the screen showing the route.\n\n---\nCarefully reflect on the interaction history of the current task. Check if there are any subgoals that are accomplished by a sequence of successful actions and can be consolidated into new \"Shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions. For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",
