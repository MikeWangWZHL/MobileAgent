Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.",

The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[94, 42]; text: 3:57\n[161, 432]; text: Settings\n[664, 431]; text: Notes\n[916, 431]; text: Clock\n[413, 432]; text: Contacts\n[913, 758]; text: Gallery\n[161, 757]; text: Chrome\n[665, 756]; text: YouTube\n[413, 759]; text: Google\n[914, 966]; text: m\n[664, 967]; text: 31\n[162, 1084]; text: Maps\n[416, 1085]; text: Gmail\n[664, 1084]; text: Calendar\n[915, 1084]; text: McDonald's\n[161, 1412]; text: Amazon Shopping\n[414, 1410]; text: Walmart\n[663, 1412]; text: Best Buy\n[916, 1412]; text: Tripadvisor\n[663, 1618]; text: 8\n[913, 1618]; text: Booking\n[164, 1613]; text: Lemon8\n[914, 1737]; text: Booking.com\n[415, 1739]; text: X\n[662, 1738]; text: Fandango\n[161, 1737]; text: Lemon8\n[202, 2077]; text: c\n[251, 2271]; text: III\n[852, 2267]; text: <\n[543, 2269]; text: \u25cb\n[870, 2077]; icon: The app logo is circular with pink background, white border and black camera inside it.\n[413, 314]; icon: This is an icon.\n[914, 314]; icon: The app logo is circular with two white clock hands, indicating time, against a purple background.\n[914, 1294]; icon: The app logo shows a green circle with black outlines around it, inside which there's a white owl facing to the right.\n[163, 641]; icon: The icon has a circle shape with three concentric circles inside, colored green at the outermost part, blue in the middle, and red on the innermost layer.\n[413, 967]; icon: The app logo, shaped like a circle with rounded corners, features two overlapping \"M\"s colored red on top and green at bottom.\n[664, 967]; icon: The app logo is circle with blue background, white number thirty-one inside it, and red and green lines around outside edge.\n[413, 641]; icon: The Google app logo on Android devices has been simplified to just its letter \"G\" with rounded edges, colored yellow at the top transitioning into blue at the bottom.\n[413, 1294]; icon: This is an icon.\n[663, 315]; icon: This is an icon.\n[203, 2077]; icon: This is an icon.\n[163, 315]; icon: The app logo displays a white gear inside a blue circle with rounded corners.\n[537, 2076]; icon: The app logo has two blue chat bubbles overlapping each other with the top bubble slightly smaller than the bottom bubble, all enclosed within a white square.\n[163, 1293]; icon: This is an icon.\n[914, 640]; icon: The app logo has a pink background with white flower design on it.\n[163, 967]; icon: This is an icon.\n[163, 1621]; icon: The icon is round, yellow with black text that reads \"lemon8\".\n[664, 640]; icon: The app logo is a red play button with a white outline, set against a gray background that resembles a circle.\n[663, 1294]; icon: The icon is round, yellow with blue border and has white text inside that says \"Tag\".\n[663, 1621]; icon: The app logo is orange with white text that says \"F\" inside it, enclosed by a black circle.\n[914, 968]; icon: The logo is shaped like two arcs with three legs, colored red on top and yellow at bottom.\n[913, 1620]; icon: The icon is round, blue with white text that says \"Booking\".\n[413, 1620]; icon: The icon is shaped like an \"X\" and is black with a white outline.\n[413, 1621]; icon: The icon is shaped like a letter X, outlined with white lines against a black background.\n[662, 315]; icon: The app logo is a white book with red pages on top, placed against a solid background of bright red.\n[659, 1293]; icon: The icon is shaped like a rectangle with rounded corners, and its background color is yellow.\n[162, 314]; icon: This is an icon.\n[162, 966]; icon: This is an icon.\n[664, 967]; icon: This is an icon.\n[871, 2076]; icon: This is an icon.\n[202, 2076]; icon: This is an icon.\n[964, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[543, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, outlined with a thin black border, filled with grayish-white color inside.\n[160, 1234]; icon: The icon is a square with green stripes on a white background.\n[414, 965]; icon: The icon is a white \"M\" with red outline, depicting Gmail app logo on a blue background.\n[913, 638]; icon: The icon is shaped like a flower with six petals, all colored white except for the center which is pinkish-purple.\n[412, 1292]; icon: The icon is shaped like half a circle with three straight sides, and it's filled with yellow-orange hues.\n[539, 2081]; icon: The icon is shaped like two blue speech bubbles overlapping each other, with the top bubble slightly smaller than the bottom one.\n[913, 1294]; icon: The logo is shaped like two eyes stacked on top of each other with white outlines, filled in green.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 162, 'y': 1084}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Maps app icon to open the app and proceed with the task of finding a bakery nearby. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **BakeLab**   - Rating: 4.8 (260 reviews)   - Distance: 0.8 miles   - Price Range: $1\u2013$10   - Status: Open (Closes at 6 PM)   - Description: Offers birthday cakes, with positive reviews about the quality of cakes.   - Phone Number: [Call button visible, phone number needs to be retrieved].  No other important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 162, 'y': 1084}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Maps app icon to open the app and proceed with the task of finding a bakery nearby. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': 'bakery near me that does birthday cakes'}} | Description: Tapping the search bar, typing \"bakery near me that does birthday cakes,\" and initiating the search to find relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **BakeLab**   - Rating: 4.8 (260 reviews)   - Distance: 0.8 miles   - Price Range: $1\u2013$10   - Status: Open (Closes at 6 PM)   - Description: Offers birthday cakes, with positive reviews about the quality of cakes.   - Phone Number: +1 217-666-0355\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 162, 'y': 1084}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Maps app icon to open the app and proceed with the task of finding a bakery nearby. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': 'bakery near me that does birthday cakes'}} | Description: Tapping the search bar, typing \"bakery near me that does birthday cakes,\" and initiating the search to find relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 839, 'y': 1852}} | Description: Tapping the \"Call\" button to retrieve BakeLab's phone number.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **BakeLab**   - Rating: 4.8 (260 reviews)   - Distance: 0.8 miles   - Price Range: $1\u2013$10   - Status: Open (Closes at 6 PM)   - Description: Offers birthday cakes, with positive reviews about the quality of cakes.   - Phone Number: +1 217-666-0355\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 162, 'y': 1084}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Maps app icon to open the app and proceed with the task of finding a bakery nearby. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': 'bakery near me that does birthday cakes'}} | Description: Tapping the search bar, typing \"bakery near me that does birthday cakes,\" and initiating the search to find relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 839, 'y': 1852}} | Description: Tapping the \"Call\" button to retrieve BakeLab's phone number.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **BakeLab**   - Rating: 4.8 (260 reviews)   - Distance: 0.8 miles   - Price Range: $1\u2013$10   - Status: Open (Closes at 6 PM)   - Description: Offers birthday cakes, with positive reviews about the quality of cakes.   - Phone Number: +1 217-666-0355\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 162, 'y': 1084}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Maps app icon to open the app and proceed with the task of finding a bakery nearby. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': 'bakery near me that does birthday cakes'}} | Description: Tapping the search bar, typing \"bakery near me that does birthday cakes,\" and initiating the search to find relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 839, 'y': 1852}} | Description: Tapping the \"Call\" button to retrieve BakeLab's phone number. This will display the number, which I will use to create a new note in the Notes app. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: Returning to the home screen to access the Notes app and proceed with creating a new note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 664, 'y': 431}} | Description: Tapping on the Notes app icon to open it and prepare for creating a new note with the bakery's name and phone number. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",
