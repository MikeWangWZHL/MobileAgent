Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13. If a task involves multiple apps (e.g., Google Maps and Notes), ensure smooth transitions between apps and verify that the required information is correctly transferred.",

The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[97, 42]; text: 4:03\n[161, 432]; text: Settings\n[664, 431]; text: Notes\n[916, 431]; text: Clock\n[413, 432]; text: Contacts\n[913, 758]; text: Gallery\n[161, 757]; text: Chrome\n[665, 756]; text: YouTube\n[413, 759]; text: Google\n[914, 966]; text: m\n[664, 967]; text: 31\n[162, 1084]; text: Maps\n[416, 1085]; text: Gmail\n[664, 1084]; text: Calendar\n[915, 1084]; text: McDonald's\n[161, 1412]; text: Amazon Shopping\n[414, 1410]; text: Walmart\n[663, 1412]; text: Best Buy\n[916, 1412]; text: Tripadvisor\n[663, 1618]; text: 8\n[913, 1618]; text: Booking\n[164, 1613]; text: Lemon8\n[914, 1737]; text: Booking.com\n[415, 1739]; text: X\n[662, 1738]; text: Fandango\n[161, 1737]; text: Lemon8\n[202, 2077]; text: c\n[251, 2271]; text: III\n[852, 2267]; text: <\n[543, 2269]; text: \u25cb\n[870, 2077]; icon: This is an icon.\n[413, 314]; icon: The icon is round with a red background, white outline around the edge, and a person's silhouette inside it.\n[914, 1294]; icon: This is an icon.\n[163, 641]; icon: The icon has a circle shape with three concentric circles inside, colored green at the outermost part, blue in the middle, and red on the innermost layer.\n[413, 967]; icon: This is an icon.\n[664, 967]; icon: This is an icon.\n[413, 641]; icon: The Google app logo on Android devices has been simplified to just its letter \"G\" with rounded edges, colored yellow at the top transitioning into blue at the bottom.\n[413, 1294]; icon: The app logo has seven yellow petals on blue background, forming a circle.\n[663, 315]; icon: The app logo is circular, with red background and white notepad on it.\n[203, 2077]; icon: The app logo is circular with green background, white border and black letter \"C\" inside it.\n[163, 315]; icon: The app logo displays a white gear inside a blue circle with rounded corners.\n[537, 2076]; icon: This is an icon.\n[163, 1293]; icon: The Amazon logo, which appears as a brown smiley face with green lines on its forehead, is enclosed within a white square.\n[914, 641]; icon: The app logo is circular with a pink background, white border, and a flower graphic at its center.\n[163, 967]; icon: The app logo is circular with a white background, featuring a green pin that has blue and red stripes around it.\n[163, 1621]; icon: This is an icon.\n[664, 640]; icon: The app logo is a red play button with a white outline, set against a gray background that resembles a circle.\n[663, 1294]; icon: The icon is round, yellow with blue border and has white text inside that says \"Tag\".\n[663, 1621]; icon: The app logo is orange with white text that says \"F\" inside it, enclosed by a black circle.\n[914, 968]; icon: The logo is shaped like two arcs with three legs, colored red on top and yellow at bottom.\n[914, 314]; icon: The app logo is circular with black lines depicting clock hands, set against a purple background.\n[913, 1620]; icon: The icon is round, blue with white text that says \"Booking\".\n[413, 1620]; icon: The icon is shaped like an \"X\" and is black with a white outline.\n[413, 1621]; icon: The icon is shaped like a letter X, outlined with white lines against a black background.\n[662, 315]; icon: The app logo is a white book with red pages on top, placed against a solid background of bright red.\n[659, 1293]; icon: This is an icon.\n[162, 314]; icon: The icon is circular with multiple gray cogs inside it, bordered by a white outline on a blue background.\n[162, 966]; icon: This is an icon.\n[664, 967]; icon: This is an icon.\n[871, 2076]; icon: This is an icon.\n[202, 2076]; icon: This is an icon.\n[964, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[543, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, outlined with a thin black border, filled with grayish-white color inside.\n[160, 1234]; icon: The icon is a square with green stripes on a white background.\n[414, 966]; icon: The Gmail app logo on my home screen has a blue rounded square with white letters \"G\" and \"M\".\n[913, 638]; icon: The icon is shaped like a flower with six petals, all colored white against a pink background.\n[412, 1291]; icon: The icon is shaped like a hexagon with rounded corners, and it has a yellow background with a black outline.\n[539, 2081]; icon: The icon is shaped like two blue speech bubbles overlapping each other, with the top bubble slightly smaller than the bottom one.\n[914, 1294]; icon: The logo for TripAdvisor, which features two white owl eyes on a green background.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13. If a task involves multiple apps (e.g., Google Maps and Notes), ensure smooth transitions between apps and verify that the required information is correctly transferred.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13. If a task involves multiple apps (e.g., Google Maps and Notes), ensure smooth transitions between apps and verify that the required information is correctly transferred.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: This action will open the Google Maps app, allowing me to proceed with the search for a Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13. If a task involves multiple apps (e.g., Google Maps and Notes), ensure smooth transitions between apps and verify that the required information is correctly transferred.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\" has been completed. - A few restaurants are visible in the results:  - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1\u2605 (215 reviews), price range $10\u201320, open until 8 PM. It is a counter-serve chain specializing in build-your-own stir-fries and other classic Chinese dishes.  - **Chinese Kitchen**: Rated 4.2\u2605, described as offering \"Good Chinese food, quick service.\"  - **Jess Cafe**: Rated 4.7\u2605, with mentions of spring rolls, fried rice, and lo mein in reviews.  - **Fong's #3 Chinese Restaurant**: Visible in the results but no detailed information provided in the screenshot.  Next step: Select a popular restaurant (e.g., Jess Cafe or Chinese Kitchen) and check for recent posts about their signature dishes on X.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: This action will open the Google Maps app, allowing me to proceed with the search for a Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\"}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport,\" and execute the search. This will display relevant results for Chinese restaurants near the specified location. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note: Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13. If a task involves multiple apps (e.g., Google Maps and Notes), ensure smooth transitions between apps and verify that the required information is correctly transferred.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\" has been completed.  - A few restaurants are visible in the results:   - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1\u2605 (215 reviews), price range $10\u201320, open until 8 PM. It is a counter-serve chain specializing in build-your-own stir-fries and other classic Chinese dishes.   - **Chinese Kitchen**: Rated 4.2\u2605, described as offering \"Good Chinese food, quick service.\"   - **Jess Cafe**: Rated 4.7\u2605, with mentions of spring rolls, fried rice, and lo mein in reviews.   - **Fong's #3 Chinese Restaurant**: Visible in the results but no detailed information provided in the screenshot.  Next step: Select a popular restaurant (e.g., Jess Cafe or Chinese Kitchen) and check for recent posts about their signature dishes on X.  - The X app is now accessible from the home screen.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: This action will open the Google Maps app, allowing me to proceed with the search for a Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\"}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport,\" and execute the search. This will display relevant results for Chinese restaurants near the specified location. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the X app to search for recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13. If a task involves multiple apps (e.g., Google Maps and Notes), ensure smooth transitions between apps and verify that the required information is correctly transferred.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\" has been completed.   - A few restaurants are visible in the results:    - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1\u2605 (215 reviews), price range $10\u201320, open until 8 PM. It is a counter-serve chain specializing in build-your-own stir-fries and other classic Chinese dishes.    - **Chinese Kitchen**: Rated 4.2\u2605, described as offering \"Good Chinese food, quick service.\"    - **Jess Cafe**: Rated 4.7\u2605, with mentions of spring rolls, fried rice, and lo mein in reviews.    - **Fong's #3 Chinese Restaurant**: Visible in the results but no detailed information provided in the screenshot.  - Next step: Select a popular restaurant (e.g., Jess Cafe or Chinese Kitchen) and check for recent posts about their signature dishes on X.  - The X app is now accessible from the home screen.  No new relevant information was found in the current screen.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: This action will open the Google Maps app, allowing me to proceed with the search for a Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\"}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport,\" and execute the search. This will display relevant results for Chinese restaurants near the specified location. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the X app to search for recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'X'}} | Description: This action will open the X app, allowing me to search for recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13. If a task involves multiple apps (e.g., Google Maps and Notes), ensure smooth transitions between apps and verify that the required information is correctly transferred.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\" has been completed.   - A few restaurants are visible in the results:    - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1\u2605 (215 reviews), price range $10\u201320, open until 8 PM. It is a counter-serve chain specializing in build-your-own stir-fries and other classic Chinese dishes.    - **Chinese Kitchen**: Rated 4.2\u2605, described as offering \"Good Chinese food, quick service.\"    - **Jess Cafe**: Rated 4.7\u2605, with mentions of spring rolls, fried rice, and lo mein in reviews.    - **Fong's #3 Chinese Restaurant**: Visible in the results but no detailed information provided in the screenshot.  - Next step: Select a popular restaurant (e.g., Jess Cafe or Chinese Kitchen) and check for recent posts about their signature dishes on X.  - The X app is now accessible from the home screen.  No new relevant information was found in the current screen.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: This action will open the Google Maps app, allowing me to proceed with the search for a Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\"}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport,\" and execute the search. This will display relevant results for Chinese restaurants near the specified location. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the X app to search for recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'X'}} | Description: This action will open the X app, allowing me to search for recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 268, 'y': 2123}} | Description: This action will tap the magnifying glass icon to open the search bar in the X app, enabling me to search for recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}.

When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13. If a task involves multiple apps (e.g., Google Maps and Notes), ensure smooth transitions between apps and verify that the required information is correctly transferred.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\" has been completed.   - A few restaurants are visible in the results:    - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1\u2605 (215 reviews), price range $10\u201320, open until 8 PM. It is a counter-serve chain specializing in build-your-own stir-fries and other classic Chinese dishes.    - **Chinese Kitchen**: Rated 4.2\u2605, described as offering \"Good Chinese food, quick service.\"    - **Jess Cafe**: Rated 4.7\u2605, with mentions of spring rolls, fried rice, and lo mein in reviews.    - **Fong's #3 Chinese Restaurant**: Visible in the results but no detailed information provided in the screenshot.  - Recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes:   - A post from 30 Sep mentions **Jerk chicken, Jollof rice, Potato salad, Plantains, Jerky carrots**, and **Passion fruit fresh cream vanilla cake**.   - The post includes images of the dishes, showcasing a variety of vibrant and appetizing meals.   - Another post (dated 09 Feb 21) mentions **Creamy tagliatelle carbonara with garlic bread** and **Old-fashioned baked rice pudding with evaporated milk & jam**, but these dishes may not be related to Jess Cafe.  Next step: Summarize these findings in the Notes app.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\"}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport,\" and execute the search. This will display relevant results for Chinese restaurants near the specified location. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the X app to search for recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'X'}} | Description: This action will open the X app, allowing me to search for recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 268, 'y': 2123}} | Description: This action will tap the magnifying glass icon to open the search bar in the X app, enabling me to search for recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Jess Cafe signature dishes'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the X app, type \"Jess Cafe signature dishes,\" and execute the search to find relevant posts about the restaurant's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13. If a task involves multiple apps (e.g., Google Maps and Notes), ensure smooth transitions between apps and verify that the required information is correctly transferred.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\" has been completed.   - A few restaurants are visible in the results:    - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1\u2605 (215 reviews), price range $10\u201320, open until 8 PM. It is a counter-serve chain specializing in build-your-own stir-fries and other classic Chinese dishes.    - **Chinese Kitchen**: Rated 4.2\u2605, described as offering \"Good Chinese food, quick service.\"    - **Jess Cafe**: Rated 4.7\u2605, with mentions of spring rolls, fried rice, and lo mein in reviews.    - **Fong's #3 Chinese Restaurant**: Visible in the results but no detailed information provided in the screenshot.  - Recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes:   - A post from 30 Sep mentions **Jerk chicken, Jollof rice, Potato salad, Plantains, Jerky carrots**, and **Passion fruit fresh cream vanilla cake**.   - The post includes images of the dishes, showcasing a variety of vibrant and appetizing meals.   - Another post (dated 09 Feb 21) mentions **Creamy tagliatelle carbonara with garlic bread** and **Old-fashioned baked rice pudding with evaporated milk & jam**, but these dishes may not be related to Jess Cafe.  Next step: Summarize these findings in the Notes app.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the X app to search for recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'X'}} | Description: This action will open the X app, allowing me to search for recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 268, 'y': 2123}} | Description: This action will tap the magnifying glass icon to open the search bar in the X app, enabling me to search for recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Jess Cafe signature dishes'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the X app, type \"Jess Cafe signature dishes,\" and execute the search to find relevant posts about the restaurant's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to summarize the findings about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13. If a task involves multiple apps (e.g., Google Maps and Notes), ensure smooth transitions between apps and verify that the required information is correctly transferred.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\" has been completed.   - A few restaurants are visible in the results:    - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1\u2605 (215 reviews), price range $10\u201320, open until 8 PM.

Next step: Summarize these findings in the Notes app.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'X'}} | Description: This action will open the X app, allowing me to search for recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 268, 'y': 2123}} | Description: This action will tap the magnifying glass icon to open the search bar in the X app, enabling me to search for recent posts about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 324, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Jess Cafe signature dishes'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the X app, type \"Jess Cafe signature dishes,\" and execute the search to find relevant posts about the restaurant's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to summarize the findings about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note and summarize the findings about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13. If a task involves multiple apps (e.g., Google Maps and Notes), ensure smooth transitions between apps and verify that the required information is correctly transferred.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\" has been completed.   - A few restaurants are visible in the results:    - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1\u2605 (215 reviews), price range $10\u201320, open until 8 PM.

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13. If a task involves multiple apps (e.g., Google Maps and Notes), ensure smooth transitions between apps and verify that the required information is correctly transferred.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\" has been completed.   - A few restaurants are visible in the results:    - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1\u2605 (215 reviews), price range $10\u201320, open until 8 PM.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13. If a task involves multiple apps (e.g., Google Maps and Notes), ensure smooth transitions between apps and verify that the required information is correctly transferred.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\" has been completed.   - A few restaurants are visible in the results:    - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1\u2605 (215 reviews), price range $10\u201320, open until 8 PM.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to summarize the findings about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note and summarize the findings about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Create_New_Note', 'arguments': {'text': \"Jess Cafe is a highly-rated Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport (4.7\u2605). Recent posts highlight their signature dishes, including Jerk chicken, Jollof rice, Potato salad, Plantains, Jerky carrots, and Passion fruit fresh cream vanilla cake. These dishes are described as vibrant and appetizing.\"}} | Description: This action will create a new note in the Notes app and summarize the findings about Jess Cafe's signature dishes, as gathered from recent posts. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to navigate back to Google Maps to get directions to Jess Cafe. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 100, 'y': 300}} | Description: This action will tap on the Google Maps app preview in the app switcher, bringing it to the foreground so I can proceed with getting directions to Jess Cafe. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to bring Google Maps to the foreground by tapping on its preview in the app switcher. However, the screen after the action remains the same as before, showing the app switcher interface. This indicates that the tap action did not successfully activate Google Maps.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note and summarize the findings about Jess Cafe's signature dishes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Create_New_Note', 'arguments': {'text': \"Jess Cafe is a highly-rated Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport (4.7\u2605). Recent posts highlight their signature dishes, including Jerk chicken, Jollof rice, Potato salad, Plantains, Jerky carrots, and Passion fruit fresh cream vanilla cake. These dishes are described as vibrant and appetizing.\"}} | Description: This action will create a new note in the Notes app and summarize the findings about Jess Cafe's signature dishes, as gathered from recent posts. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to navigate back to Google Maps to get directions to Jess Cafe. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 100, 'y': 300}} | Description: This action will tap on the Google Maps app preview in the app switcher, bringing it to the foreground so I can proceed with getting directions to Jess Cafe. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to bring Google Maps to the foreground by tapping on its preview in the app switcher. However, the screen after the action remains the same as before, showing the app switcher interface. This indicates that the tap action did not successfully activate Google Maps.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 100, 'y': 300}} | Description: This action will tap on the Google Maps app preview in the app switcher again, aiming to bring it to the foreground so I can proceed with getting directions to Jess Cafe. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to bring Google Maps to the foreground by tapping on its app preview in the app switcher. However, the screen after the action remains the same as before, showing the app switcher interface. This indicates that the tap action did not successfully activate Google Maps.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13. If a task involves multiple apps (e.g., Google Maps and Notes), ensure smooth transitions between apps and verify that the required information is correctly transferred.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\" has been completed.   - A few restaurants are visible in the results:    - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1\u2605 (215 reviews), price range $10\u201320, open until 8 PM.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Create_New_Note', 'arguments': {'text': \"Jess Cafe is a highly-rated Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport (4.7\u2605).

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13. If a task involves multiple apps (e.g., Google Maps and Notes), ensure smooth transitions between apps and verify that the required information is correctly transferred.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"Chinese restaurant near Chicago O'Hare airport\" has been completed.   - A few restaurants are visible in the results:    - **Manchu Wok**: Rated 2.1\u2605 (215 reviews), price range $10\u201320, open until 8 PM.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button to create a new note is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to navigate back to Google Maps to get directions to Jess Cafe. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 100, 'y': 300}} | Description: This action will tap on the Google Maps app preview in the app switcher, bringing it to the foreground so I can proceed with getting directions to Jess Cafe. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to bring Google Maps to the foreground by tapping on its preview in the app switcher. However, the screen after the action remains the same as before, showing the app switcher interface. This indicates that the tap action did not successfully activate Google Maps.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 100, 'y': 300}} | Description: This action will tap on the Google Maps app preview in the app switcher again, aiming to bring it to the foreground so I can proceed with getting directions to Jess Cafe. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to bring Google Maps to the foreground by tapping on its app preview in the app switcher. However, the screen after the action remains the same as before, showing the app switcher interface. This indicates that the tap action did not successfully activate Google Maps.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to reopen Google Maps directly and proceed with getting directions to Jess Cafe. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Maps'}} | Description: This action will open the Google Maps app from the home screen, allowing me to proceed with getting directions to Jess Cafe. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Check if there are any subgoals that are accomplished by a sequence of successful actions and can be consolidated into new \"Shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions. For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When searching for restaurants or businesses, ensure the query includes specific details like location, type of cuisine, and operational hours to narrow down results effectively.  5. Always verify the operational hours of businesses to ensure they meet the user's requirements, especially for late-night or time-sensitive searches.  6. When filtering search results (e.g., by rating or distance), ensure the filter criteria are applied correctly to avoid irrelevant results.  7. Double-check the selected location or business to ensure it matches the user's requirements (e.g., rating, proximity, or specific services offered) before proceeding to the route screen.  8. If the task involves creating a route, confirm that the route is displayed correctly and matches the intended destination before marking the subgoal as complete.  9. When navigating through menus or categories, use a systematic approach to ensure all relevant sections are explored thoroughly.  10. If an action does not return to the expected screen, use alternative navigation methods (e.g., tapping \"X\" or returning to the home screen) to correct the workflow.  11. When summarizing customer feedback, include both positive and negative aspects to provide a balanced overview.  12. When retrieving contact information, ensure the details (e.g., phone number or address) are accurate and match the selected business before saving them in Notes.  13.
