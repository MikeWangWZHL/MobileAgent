Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open. - The current screen highlights the McRib promotion (\"McRib is back\") and includes options like \"Get a McRib Now\" and \"Play Gift Exchange.\" - The menu section is visible, showing categories such as \"Limited Time: McRib,\" \"Sandwiches & Meals,\" and \"Happy Meals.\" - The bottom navigation bar includes options: Home, Order, Rewards & Deals, Earn Points, and More. - The \"Rewards & Deals\" section is accessible from the bottom navigation bar.  No specific mention of Spicy McCrispy or related deals is visible on this screen. Proceed to check the \"Rewards & Deals\" section.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will open the McDonald's app, allowing me to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen is the \"Rewards & Deals\" section.  - The \"My Rewards\" section shows items redeemable for 4500 points, including:   - Large Frappe   - Large French Fries   - Sausage McMuffin with Egg (not available during dinner).  - The \"Deals\" section is visible, and one of the deals includes a sandwich resembling the Spicy McCrispy.  - The pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\" with an option to change the location.  - The bottom navigation bar includes options: Home, Order, Rewards & Deals, Earn Points, and More.  Next step: Add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will open the McDonald's app, allowing me to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 537, 'y': 2166}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Rewards & Deals\" option in the bottom navigation bar, navigating to the section where I can check for any deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Check for any rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. \u2705  3. If a deal exists, add the Spicy McCrispy to the mobile order without completing the payment.  4. Check the pickup location in the McDonald's app.  5. Open Google Maps and search for the pickup location.  6. Display the route to the pickup location in Google Maps.\n\n### Progress Status ###\nThe Spicy McCrispy deal has been successfully located, and the details are displayed. The next step is to add the deal to the mobile order.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nAdd the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order.\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone. Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[101, 42]; text: 11:14\n[182, 263]; text: Deal\n[94, 258]; text: \u25cf\n[507, 376]; text: 40% off a McCrispyTM,\n[531, 498]; text: y McCrispyTM,\n[182, 496]; text: Spicy\n[612, 611]; text: McCrispyTM\n[208, 611]; text: Deluxe\n[378, 726]; text: or Deluxe Spicy\n[514, 837]; text: McCrispyTM (excludes\n[142, 952]; text: tax)\n[192, 1063]; text: Valid 1x/day\n[223, 1151]; text: View eligible items\n[237, 1245]; text: Expires 12/29/2024\nView terms of this offer\n[665, 1267]; text: Participating Restaurants\n[528, 1339]; text: Offer not available during Breakfast.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen is the \"Rewards & Deals\" section.  - The \"My Rewards\" section shows items redeemable for 4500 points, including:   - Large Frappe   - Large French Fries   - Sausage McMuffin with Egg (not available during dinner).  - The \"Deals\" section is visible, and one of the deals includes a sandwich resembling the Spicy McCrispy.  - The pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\" with an option to change the location.  - The bottom navigation bar includes options: Home, Order, Rewards & Deals, Earn Points, and More.  - A deal is available for \"40% off a McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).\"   - Valid 1x/day.   - Expires 12/29/2024.   - Offer not available during breakfast or after midnight.  - The current screen provides an option to \"Add to Mobile Order.\"  - The next step is to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will open the McDonald's app, allowing me to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 537, 'y': 2166}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Rewards & Deals\" option in the bottom navigation bar, navigating to the section where I can check for any deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 533, 'y': 1802}} | Description: This action will tap on the Spicy McCrispy deal in the \"Deals\" section, allowing me to view the details and add it to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will open the McDonald's app, allowing me to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 537, 'y': 2166}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Rewards & Deals\" option in the bottom navigation bar, navigating to the section where I can check for any deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 533, 'y': 1802}} | Description: This action will tap on the Spicy McCrispy deal in the \"Deals\" section, allowing me to view the details and add it to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 543, 'y': 2268}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button, initiating the process of adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. However, instead of proceeding with the mobile order process, the screen transitioned to the home screen of the device. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was not successfully tapped, or the app may have been unintentionally exited.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen is the \"Rewards & Deals\" section.  - The \"My Rewards\" section shows items redeemable for 4500 points, including:   - Large Frappe   - Large French Fries   - Sausage McMuffin with Egg (not available during dinner).  - The \"Deals\" section is visible, and one of the deals includes a sandwich resembling the Spicy McCrispy.  - The pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\" with an option to change the location.  - The bottom navigation bar includes options: Home, Order, Rewards & Deals, Earn Points, and More.  - A deal is available for \"40% off a McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).\"   - Valid 1x/day.   - Expires 12/29/2024.   - Offer not available during breakfast or after midnight.  - The current screen provides an option to \"Add to Mobile Order.\"  - The next step is to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will open the McDonald's app, allowing me to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 537, 'y': 2166}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Rewards & Deals\" option in the bottom navigation bar, navigating to the section where I can check for any deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 533, 'y': 1802}} | Description: This action will tap on the Spicy McCrispy deal in the \"Deals\" section, allowing me to view the details and add it to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 543, 'y': 2268}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button, initiating the process of adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. However, instead of proceeding with the mobile order process, the screen transitioned to the home screen of the device. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was not successfully tapped, or the app may have been unintentionally exited.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will reopen the McDonald's app, allowing me to return to the \"Rewards & Deals\" section and proceed with adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen is the \"Rewards & Deals\" section.  - The \"My Rewards\" section shows items redeemable for 4500 points, including:   - Large Frappe   - Large French Fries   - Sausage McMuffin with Egg (not available during dinner).  - The \"Deals\" section is visible, and one of the deals includes a sandwich resembling the Spicy McCrispy.  - The pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\" with an option to change the location.  - The bottom navigation bar includes options: Home, Order, Rewards & Deals, Earn Points, and More.  - A deal is available for \"40% off a McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).\"   - Valid 1x/day.   - Expires 12/29/2024.   - Offer not available during breakfast or after midnight.  - The current screen provides an option to \"Add to Mobile Order.\"  - The next step is to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 537, 'y': 2166}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Rewards & Deals\" option in the bottom navigation bar, navigating to the section where I can check for any deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 533, 'y': 1802}} | Description: This action will tap on the Spicy McCrispy deal in the \"Deals\" section, allowing me to view the details and add it to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 543, 'y': 2268}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button, initiating the process of adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. However, instead of proceeding with the mobile order process, the screen transitioned to the home screen of the device. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was not successfully tapped, or the app may have been unintentionally exited.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will reopen the McDonald's app, allowing me to return to the \"Rewards & Deals\" section and proceed with adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 543, 'y': 2268}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the mobile order customization or confirmation screen. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order by tapping the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button. However, the screen after the action shows the home screen of the device instead of the McDonald's app, indicating that the app was exited or closed unintentionally.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen is the \"Rewards & Deals\" section.  - The \"My Rewards\" section shows items redeemable for 4500 points, including:   - Large Frappe   - Large French Fries   - Sausage McMuffin with Egg (not available during dinner).  - The \"Deals\" section is visible, and one of the deals includes a sandwich resembling the Spicy McCrispy.  - The pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\" with an option to change the location.  - The bottom navigation bar includes options: Home, Order, Rewards & Deals, Earn Points, and More.  - A deal is available for \"40% off a McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).\"   - Valid 1x/day.   - Expires 12/29/2024.   - Offer not available during breakfast or after midnight.  - The current screen provides an option to \"Add to Mobile Order.\"  - The next step is to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 533, 'y': 1802}} | Description: This action will tap on the Spicy McCrispy deal in the \"Deals\" section, allowing me to view the details and add it to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 543, 'y': 2268}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button, initiating the process of adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. However, instead of proceeding with the mobile order process, the screen transitioned to the home screen of the device. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was not successfully tapped, or the app may have been unintentionally exited.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will reopen the McDonald's app, allowing me to return to the \"Rewards & Deals\" section and proceed with adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 543, 'y': 2268}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the mobile order customization or confirmation screen. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order by tapping the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button. However, the screen after the action shows the home screen of the device instead of the McDonald's app, indicating that the app was exited or closed unintentionally.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will reopen the McDonald's app, allowing me to return to the \"Rewards & Deals\" section and proceed with adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

If so, help me add that to Mobile Order (Do not pay yet, I will do it myself). And then check the pickup location and get directions on Google Maps. Stop at the screen showing the route.\n\n### Overall Plan ###\nThe current plan remains valid: 1. Open the McDonald's app. 2. Check for any rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. 3. If a deal exists, add the Spicy McCrispy to the mobile order without completing the payment. 4. Check the pickup location in the McDonald's app. 5. Open Google Maps and search for the pickup location. 6. Display the route to the pickup location in Google Maps.\n\n### Progress Status ###\nThe McDonald's app has been reopened, and the \"Rewards & Deals\" section is displayed with the Spicy McCrispy deal visible. The next step is to add the deal to the mobile order.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nAdd the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order using the \"Add to Mobile Order\" option.\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone. Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[99, 41]; text: 11:18\n[182, 263]; text: Deal\n[94, 258]; text: \u25cf\n[507, 376]; text: 40% off a McCrispyTM,\n[531, 498]; text: y McCrispyTM,\n[182, 496]; text: Spicy\n[612, 611]; text: McCrispyTM\n[208, 611]; text: Deluxe\n[378, 726]; text: or Deluxe Spicy\n[514, 837]; text: McCrispyTM (excludes\n[142, 952]; text: tax)\n[192, 1063]; text: Valid 1x/day\n[223, 1151]; text: View eligible items\n[237, 1245]; text: Expires 12/29/2024\nView terms of this offer\n[665, 1267]; text: Participating Restaurants\n[528, 1339]; text: Offer not available during Breakfast.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen is the \"Rewards & Deals\" section.  - The \"My Rewards\" section shows items redeemable for 4500 points, including:   - Large Frappe   - Large French Fries   - Sausage McMuffin with Egg (not available during dinner).  - The \"Deals\" section is visible, and one of the deals includes a sandwich resembling the Spicy McCrispy.  - The pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\" with an option to change the location.  - The bottom navigation bar includes options: Home, Order, Rewards & Deals, Earn Points, and More.  - A deal is available for \"40% off a McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).\"   - Valid 1x/day.   - Expires 12/29/2024.   - Offer not available during breakfast or after midnight.  - The current screen provides an option to \"Add to Mobile Order.\"  - The next step is to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 543, 'y': 2268}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button, initiating the process of adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. However, instead of proceeding with the mobile order process, the screen transitioned to the home screen of the device. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was not successfully tapped, or the app may have been unintentionally exited.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will reopen the McDonald's app, allowing me to return to the \"Rewards & Deals\" section and proceed with adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 543, 'y': 2268}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the mobile order customization or confirmation screen. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order by tapping the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button. However, the screen after the action shows the home screen of the device instead of the McDonald's app, indicating that the app was exited or closed unintentionally.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will reopen the McDonald's app, allowing me to return to the \"Rewards & Deals\" section and proceed with adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the mobile order customization or confirmation screen. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is identical to the screen before the action. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was not successfully tapped, or the app did not register the action. The expected transition to the mobile order customization or confirmation screen did not occur.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen is the \"Rewards & Deals\" section.  - The \"My Rewards\" section shows items redeemable for 4500 points, including:   - Large Frappe   - Large French Fries   - Sausage McMuffin with Egg (not available during dinner).  - The \"Deals\" section is visible, and one of the deals includes a sandwich resembling the Spicy McCrispy.  - The pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\" with an option to change the location.  - The bottom navigation bar includes options: Home, Order, Rewards & Deals, Earn Points, and More.  - A deal is available for \"40% off a McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).\"   - Valid 1x/day.   - Expires 12/29/2024.   - Offer not available during breakfast or after midnight.  - The current screen provides an option to \"Add to Mobile Order.\"  - The next step is to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will reopen the McDonald's app, allowing me to return to the \"Rewards & Deals\" section and proceed with adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 543, 'y': 2268}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the mobile order customization or confirmation screen. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action intended to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order by tapping the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button. However, the screen after the action shows the home screen of the device instead of the McDonald's app, indicating that the app was exited or closed unintentionally.\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': \"McDonald's\"}} | Description: This action will reopen the McDonald's app, allowing me to return to the \"Rewards & Deals\" section and proceed with adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the mobile order customization or confirmation screen. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is identical to the screen before the action. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was not successfully tapped, or the app did not register the action. The expected transition to the mobile order customization or confirmation screen did not occur.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2100}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button, which is located slightly above the bottom of the screen. If successful, it should initiate the process of adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is identical to the screen before the action. The \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was tapped, but it did not initiate the process of adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. This could be due to a missed tap on the button or an issue with the app not registering the input.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",
