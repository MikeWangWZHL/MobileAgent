If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Amazon Shopping'}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to proceed with searching for the Bose QC45 headphones. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new important notes to record. The search for \"Bose QC45 headphones\" has been successfully initiated, and the search results are displayed.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Amazon Shopping'}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to proceed with searching for the Bose QC45 headphones. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Bose QC45 headphones'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Bose QC45 headphones,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will display the search results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Amazon Shopping'}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to proceed with searching for the Bose QC45 headphones. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Bose QC45 headphones'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Bose QC45 headphones,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will display the search results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 506, 'y': 1880}} | Description: I will tap on the product listing for the Bose QuietComfort headphones to navigate to the product page and access the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Amazon Shopping'}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to proceed with searching for the Bose QC45 headphones. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Bose QC45 headphones'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Bose QC45 headphones,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will display the search results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 506, 'y': 1880}} | Description: I will tap on the product listing for the Bose QuietComfort headphones to navigate to the product page and access the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll down the product page and reveal the reviews section. This action is expected to display more content, including user reviews. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[101, 41]; text: 11:25\n[518, 169]; text: Bose QC45 headphones\n[133, 290]; text: In Stock\n[513, 290]; text: In Stock\n[895, 292]; text: In Stock\n[289, 508]; text: Delivery\n[789, 508]; text: Pickup\n[359, 726]; text: -43%*1990\n[238, 820]; text: List Price: $349.00\n[212, 900]; text: FREE Returns\n[507, 957]; text: FREE delivery Tuesday, December 17.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The product page for the Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) headphones has been successfully opened.  - Product details:   - Name: Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones   - Features: Wireless, Over-Ear Noise Cancelling, Mic, Up to 24 Hours of Battery Life   - Color: Black   - Rating: 4.5 stars (6,983 reviews)   - Popularity: 10K+ units bought in the past month  - Pricing:   - Current price: $199.00 (43% off from the list price of $349.00)   - Available colors: Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac   - All colors are in stock.  - Additional details:   - FREE Returns   - FREE delivery by Tuesday, December 17 (if ordered within 15 hours and 36 minutes).   - Arrives before Christmas.   - Ships from and sold by Adorama.   - Delivery location: Champaign 61820.  No new information about the reviews section has been located yet. The next step is to scroll further down to find the reviews.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Amazon Shopping'}} | Description: This action will open the Amazon Shopping app, allowing me to proceed with searching for the Bose QC45 headphones. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Bose QC45 headphones'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Bose QC45 headphones,\" and press Enter to initiate the search. This will display the search results for the product. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 506, 'y': 1880}} | Description: I will tap on the product listing for the Bose QuietComfort headphones to navigate to the product page and access the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll down the product page and reveal the reviews section. This action is expected to display more content, including user reviews. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the product page, which should reveal the reviews section or bring it closer to being visible. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

The next step is to scroll further down to find the reviews.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 309, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Bose QC45 headphones'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Bose QC45 headphones,\" and press Enter to initiate the search.

This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 506, 'y': 1880}} | Description: I will tap on the product listing for the Bose QuietComfort headphones to navigate to the product page and access the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll down the product page and reveal the reviews section. This action is expected to display more content, including user reviews. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the product page, which should reveal the reviews section or bring it closer to being visible. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll down the product page and reveal the reviews section. This action is expected to display more content, including user reviews. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the product page, which should reveal the reviews section or bring it closer to being visible. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the product page, which should reveal the reviews section or bring it closer to being visible. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the product page.

If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}.

Open the Notes app and record the summary.\n\n### Progress Status ###\nThe screen has scrolled further down, revealing new content, but the reviews section is still not visible. The next subgoal remains to scroll further down the product page to locate the reviews section.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nScroll further down the product page to locate the reviews section.\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone. Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the product page.

The content displayed before and after the action remains the same, and the reviews section is still not visible.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page. This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here.

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[104, 42]; text: 11:40\n[518, 169]; text: Bose QC45 headphones\n[539, 2141]; text: 8\n[757, 2138]; text: ne\n[975, 2137]; text: I\u4e09\n[539, 2138]; icon: The icon is circular, contains a filled-in white outline of a person with black hair, and has a gray background.\n[103, 2139]; icon: This is an icon.\n[321, 2137]; icon: This is an icon.\n[754, 2138]; icon: The icon is a white shopping cart on a blue background with a zero symbol inside it, indicating that there are no items in the cart.\n[483, 296]; icon: This is an icon.\n[62, 163]; icon: The icon is shaped like an arrow pointing to the left, with green fill and white outline.\n[983, 169]; icon: This is an icon.\n[544, 1876]; icon: The icon is circular with a blue background, white border, and two overlapping gray headphones.\n[963, 41]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, filled with white outlines of two bars and arrows respectively for network signal strength and data traffic.\n[542, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, outlined with a thin gray line, and filled with a solid blue color.\n[602, 169]; icon: This is an icon.\n[926, 40]; icon: This is an icon.\n[220, 168]; icon: The icon is circular, with a white border surrounding it and a black magnifying glass symbol inside.\n[975, 2137]; icon: The icon is composed of three horizontal lines, each varying slightly in shade of gray.\n[227, 42]; icon: The icon is a white horizontal line with two black dots at each end, and it represents a minus or subtraction symbol.\n[590, 277]; icon: The icon is oval-shaped with curved edges, filled with greenish-blue color.\n[150, 41]; icon: The icon is circular, white with green outline, showing a heart symbol, and has black\u6570\u5b57 \"11\uff1a40\" inside it.\n[1011, 42]; icon: The battery icon is rectangular with rounded corners, filled with white lines to represent different levels of charge, and has a green background.\n[241, 2268]; icon: The icon has three vertical lines that are gray or silver, with two slightly thicker than one at the top.\n[847, 2268]; icon: The arrow icon on the phone screen has a white outline with a blue fill, pointing to the left.\n[181, 42]; icon: The icon is circular, white with a red heart symbol at its center.\n[975, 42]; icon: The icon is shaped like a mountain with a single bar at the top, colored white on a green background.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The product page for the Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) headphones has been successfully opened.  - **Product details:**   - Name: Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones   - Features: Wireless, Over-Ear Noise Cancelling, Mic, Up to 24 Hours of Battery Life   - Color: Black   - Rating: 4.5 stars (6,983 reviews)   - Popularity: 10K+ units bought in the past month  - **Pricing:**   - Current price: $199.00 (43% off from the list price of $349.00)   - Available colors: Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac   - All colors are in stock.  - **Additional details:**   - FREE Returns   - Returnable until Jan 31, 2025   - FREE delivery by Tuesday, December 17 (if ordered within 15 hours and 36 minutes).   - Arrives before Christmas.   - Ships from and sold by Adorama.   - Delivery location: Champaign 61820.   - Other sellers on Amazon offer the product starting at $161.00 + $4.99 shipping.  - A similar item, Bose QuietComfort 35 (Series II) Wireless Headphones, is available for $159.90 with 947 reviews and a 4.5-star rating.  - The reviews section has not yet been located.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[102, 41]; text: 11:42\n[518, 169]; text: Bose QC45 headphones\n[790, 1767]; text: BOSE\n[756, 2139]; text: ne\n[539, 2141]; text: 8\n[538, 2138]; icon: The icon is circular, contains a single black dot inside, and has a white outline around it.\n[321, 2137]; icon: The icon is square-shaped with rounded corners, filled with white or light gray color inside to represent play/pause button for media playback.\n[103, 2139]; icon: This is an icon.\n[754, 2138]; icon: The icon is a white shopping cart on a blue background with a zero symbol inside it, indicating that there are no items in the cart.\n[740, 978]; icon: This is an icon.\n[255, 1632]; icon: This is an icon.\n[790, 1770]; icon: This is an icon.\n[983, 168]; icon: The icon is\u5706\u5f62 (round) and\u4e3b\u8981\u4ee5\u84dd\u8272\u548c\u767d\u8272\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8272\u8c03 (mainly blue and white).\n[62, 163]; icon: The icon is shaped like an arrow pointing to the left, with green fill and white outline.\n[542, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, outlined with a thin gray line, and filled with a solid blue color.\n[625, 1663]; icon: The icon is square with rounded corners, has small holes on its surface, and appears to be black or very dark gray.\n[791, 1620]; icon: The icon is round with a white background, black border, and features two overlapping rings that appear to be spinning or rotating.\n[602, 168]; icon: This is an icon.\n[974, 2138]; icon: The icon is composed of three horizontal lines, each solid black with white outlines against a transparent background.\n[964, 41]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, filled with white lines representing signal strength and battery life on a black background.\n[220, 168]; icon: This is an icon.\n[927, 41]; icon: The WiFi symbol has three lines stacked vertically, with two solid black lines at top and bottom and one dashed line in between. The background is green.\n[312, 1950]; icon: The icon appears to be a black, circular object with a curved top edge and two flat edges on either side. It could potentially represent a button or some other type of control. The background behind it is dark gray, which contrasts nicely against the black of the circle itself. There's no text visible within the circle, so its exact function remains unknown without additional context. However, given its size and position relative to other elements on the screen (if any), we can assume that it plays a significant role in the user interface of whatever app or system this screenshot belongs to. Overall, while simple at first glance, there may well be more depth to this seemingly basic design choice than meets the eye!\n[103, 2074]; icon: The icon is shaped like a house with a rounded roof, painted in shades of pinkish-red and white.\n[226, 42]; icon: The icon is a white circle with a black outline and center dot, representing a \"minus\" or subtraction symbol.\n[241, 2268]; icon: The icon is composed of three vertical, gray bars stacked on top of each other to represent a closed or minimized app window.\n[847, 2267]; icon: The arrow icon on the left side of the screen points to the left, indicating navigation or movement backward.\n[180, 42]; icon: The icon is a heart symbol with a green background, enclosed within a white circle.\n[1011, 42]; icon: The battery icon is rectangular with rounded corners, filled with white lines to represent different levels of charge, and has a green background.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

The background is green.\n[312, 1950]; icon: The icon appears to be a black, circular object with a curved top edge and two flat edges on either side. It could potentially represent a button or some other type of control. The background behind it is dark gray, which contrasts nicely against the black of the circle itself.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page. This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page. This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here. Otherwise, keep the current plan and copy it here.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nThe next subgoal to work on. If the previous subgoal is not yet complete, copy it here.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page. This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 518, 'y': 169}} | Description: I will tap on the Bose QC45 headphones product listing to open its product page. This action is expected to provide access to detailed product information and the reviews section. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The tap action on the Bose QC45 headphones product listing did not open the product page. Instead, the screen now shows a search bar with related search suggestions, indicating that the action did not achieve the intended result.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Here are some logs:\n- Attempt: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 518, 'y': 169}} | Description: I will tap on the Bose QC45 headphones product listing to open its product page. This action is expected to provide access to detailed product information and the reviews section. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The tap action on the Bose QC45 headphones product listing did not open the product page. Instead, the screen now shows a search bar with related search suggestions, indicating that the action did not achieve the intended result.\n- Attempt: Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 490, 'y': 163}} | Description: I will tap on the first search suggestion, \"Bose QC45 headphones,\" to open the product page. This action is expected to provide access to detailed product information and the reviews section. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The tap action on the first search suggestion, \"Bose QC45 headphones,\" did not result in any visible change. The screen remains on the search suggestions page, and the product page was not opened. This could be due to a failure in registering the tap action or a delay in the app's response.\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded. The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here. Otherwise, keep the current plan and copy it here.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nThe next subgoal to work on. If the previous subgoal is not yet complete, copy it here.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up again to scroll further down the product page.

The screen remains on the search suggestions page, and the product page was not opened. This could be due to a failure in registering the tap action or a delay in the app's response.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.
