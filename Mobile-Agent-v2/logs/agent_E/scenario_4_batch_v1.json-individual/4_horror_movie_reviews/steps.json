When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Open the Fandango app and search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. 2. Note the name of the movie and its release date. 3. Open the Lemon8 app and search for reviews of the movie. 4. Analyze the reviews to determine the general sentiment (positive, negative, or mixed). 5.

The existing important notes remain unchanged.\n\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded. The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new information relevant to the user's request about the latest horror movie currently in theaters was found in this screenshot. The existing important notes remain unchanged.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Fandango'}} | Description: This action will open the Fandango app, allowing me to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new information relevant to the user's request about the latest horror movie currently in theaters was found in this screenshot. The existing important notes remain unchanged.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Fandango'}} | Description: This action will open the Fandango app, allowing me to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 352, 'y': 157, 'text': 'latest horror movie'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movie,\" and execute the search to find the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Fandango'}} | Description: This action will open the Fandango app, allowing me to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 352, 'y': 157, 'text': 'latest horror movie'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movie,\" and execute the search to find the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 522, 'y': 245, 'text': 'horror movies in theaters'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies in theaters,\" and execute the search to refine the results to focus on horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here. Otherwise, keep the current plan and copy it here.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nThe next subgoal to work on. If the previous subgoal is not yet complete, copy it here. If all subgoals are completed, write \"Finished\".\n",

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[94, 42]; text: 2:07\n[483, 213]; text: ZIP CODE, MOVIE, OR THEATER\n[923, 245]; text: x\n[121, 250]; text: Y\n[543, 264]; text: horror movie90210s in theater\n[811, 509]; text: THEATERS\n[269, 510]; text: MOVIES\n[537, 1396]; text: No Theater results.\n[544, 2269]; text: O\n[242, 2270]; text: III\n[852, 2270]; text: <\n[921, 243]; icon: This is an icon.\n[124, 250]; icon: This is an icon.\n[543, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black border, and has two small dots inside representing app launchers on a smartphone home screen.\n[964, 41]; icon: The Wi-Fi symbol is circular with white outline, while the signal strength indicator is rectangular with orange fill.\n[166, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[847, 2268]; icon: The icon is shaped like an arrow pointing to the left, with a blue background and white outline.\n[926, 40]; icon: The Wi-Fi symbol is a white rectangle with two curved lines pointing to the right, inside a gray circle.\n[213, 41]; icon: The icon is a white heart on a red circle background, with a thin black border around both shapes.\n[809, 507]; icon: The icon is a white capital letter \"T\" with a blue outline, representing theaters or theatre.\n[142, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[93, 41]; icon: The time icon on the phone screen has a white background with black text displaying \"2:07\".\n[241, 2269]; icon: This is an icon.\n[269, 507]; icon: The Movies app logo on my iPhone has a white \"MOVIES\" text with black background, outlined by a thin gray border.\n[536, 1395]; icon: This is an icon.\n[992, 42]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, filled with white lines on a gray background to represent signal strength or battery life.\n[1010, 42]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, white in color, and depicts two overlapping rings.\n[976, 42]; icon: The icon is shaped like a vertical line with three horizontal lines stacked on top of each other, all white against a black background.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new information relevant to the user's request about the latest horror movie currently in theaters was found in this screenshot. The existing important notes remain unchanged.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Fandango'}} | Description: This action will open the Fandango app, allowing me to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 352, 'y': 157, 'text': 'latest horror movie'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movie,\" and execute the search to find the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 522, 'y': 245, 'text': 'horror movies in theaters'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies in theaters,\" and execute the search to refine the results to focus on horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 492, 'y': 241, 'text': '90210'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type the ZIP code \"90210\" (a commonly used ZIP code for Beverly Hills), and execute the search to refine the results for horror movies in theaters in that area. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to refine the search by entering the ZIP code \"90210.\" However, the text entered into the search bar was incorrect, resulting in \"horror movie90210s in theater\" instead of the intended query. This typo likely caused the search to fail, as no relevant results were displayed.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The existing important notes remain unchanged.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type.

Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Fandango'}} | Description: This action will open the Fandango app, allowing me to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 352, 'y': 157, 'text': 'latest horror movie'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movie,\" and execute the search to find the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 522, 'y': 245, 'text': 'horror movies in theaters'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies in theaters,\" and execute the search to refine the results to focus on horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 492, 'y': 241, 'text': '90210'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type the ZIP code \"90210\" (a commonly used ZIP code for Beverly Hills), and execute the search to refine the results for horror movies in theaters in that area. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to refine the search by entering the ZIP code \"90210.\" However, the text entered into the search bar was incorrect, resulting in \"horror movie90210s in theater\" instead of the intended query. This typo likely caused the search to fail, as no relevant results were displayed.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 245, 'text': 'horror movies in theaters 90210'}} | Description: This action will tap the \"x\" icon to clear the current text in the search bar, type the corrected query \"horror movies in theaters 90210,\" and execute the search to refine the results for horror movies currently in theaters in the specified ZIP code. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new information relevant to the user's request about the latest horror movie currently in theaters was found in this screenshot. The existing important notes remain unchanged.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 352, 'y': 157, 'text': 'latest horror movie'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movie,\" and execute the search to find the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 522, 'y': 245, 'text': 'horror movies in theaters'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies in theaters,\" and execute the search to refine the results to focus on horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 492, 'y': 241, 'text': '90210'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type the ZIP code \"90210\" (a commonly used ZIP code for Beverly Hills), and execute the search to refine the results for horror movies in theaters in that area. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to refine the search by entering the ZIP code \"90210.\" However, the text entered into the search bar was incorrect, resulting in \"horror movie90210s in theater\" instead of the intended query. This typo likely caused the search to fail, as no relevant results were displayed.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 245, 'text': 'horror movies in theaters 90210'}} | Description: This action will tap the \"x\" icon to clear the current text in the search bar, type the corrected query \"horror movies in theaters 90210,\" and execute the search to refine the results for horror movies currently in theaters in the specified ZIP code. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 246}} | Description: This action will tap the \"x\" icon to clear the current search query, allowing me to enter a broader query without the ZIP code. This should help in finding the latest horror movies in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new information relevant to the user's request about the latest horror movie currently in theaters was found in this screenshot. The existing important notes remain unchanged.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating that the search did not yield any relevant results. This could be due to an issue with the search query, the app's functionality, or a lack of data for the requested content.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}.

Check some reviews on Lemon8 about the movie and create a note in Notes with the general sentiment.\n\n### Current Plan ###\n1. Use Google to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. 2. Identify the movie and confirm its release date to ensure it is the latest. 3. Search for reviews of the movie on Lemon8. 4. Analyze the reviews to determine the general sentiment (positive, negative, or mixed). 5. Open the Notes app and create a new note summarizing the sentiment of the reviews.\n\n### Previous Subgoal ###\nUse Google to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters.\n\n### Progress Status ###\nThe search query has been cleared successfully. The next step is to enter a broader query, such as \"horror movies in theaters,\" to find the latest horror movies currently playing.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo new information relevant to the user's request about the latest horror movie currently in theaters was found in this screenshot. The existing important notes remain unchanged.\n\n### Potentially Stuck! ###\nYou have encountered several failed attempts. Here are some logs:\n- Attempt: Action: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'latest horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movies,\" and execute the search to find the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"latest horror movies\" was entered into the search bar, but no results were displayed. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating that the search did not yield any relevant results. This could be due to an issue with the search query, the app's functionality, or a lack of data for the requested content.\n- Attempt: Action: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 482, 'y': 242, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies,\" and execute the search. This broader query may yield results for horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to type \"horror movies\" into the search bar, but the input was garbled, resulting in \"latest horrorhorror movies mo\\\" being entered. This likely caused the search to fail, as the query was not properly formatted. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating no progress was made.\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded. The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here. Otherwise, keep the current plan and copy it here.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nThe next subgoal to work on. If the previous subgoal is not yet complete, copy it here. If all subgoals are completed, write \"Finished\".\n",

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[90, 42]; text: 2:11\n[483, 213]; text: ZIP CODE, MOVIE, OR THEATER\n[923, 245]; text: x\n[121, 250]; text: Y\n[547, 264]; text: latest horrorhorror movies mo\\\n[811, 509]; text: THEATERS\n[269, 510]; text: MOVIES\n[537, 1396]; text: No Theater results.\n[544, 2269]; text: O\n[242, 2270]; text: III\n[852, 2270]; text: <\n[921, 243]; icon: The icon is a white circle with a red outline, depicting a cross or \"X\" symbol.\n[123, 250]; icon: This is an icon.\n[543, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black border, and has two small dots inside representing app launchers on a smartphone home screen.\n[964, 41]; icon: The Wi-Fi symbol is a circle with three horizontal lines inside, colored white on a blue background; the signal strength indicator below it shows two out of five bars full, depicted by yellow vertical stripes on a gray background.\n[156, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[202, 41]; icon: The icon is a white heart inside a blue circle with a gray border.\n[847, 2268]; icon: The icon is shaped like an arrow pointing to the left, with a blue background and white outline.\n[927, 41]; icon: The Wi-Fi symbol is composed of three lines stacked on top of each other, with two diagonal arrows pointing up and down at either end, all enclosed within a circle. The background color is white while the line colors vary between black or gray depending on whether it's connected to internet or not.\n[809, 507]; icon: The icon is a white capital letter \"T\" with a blue outline, representing theaters or theatre.\n[137, 42]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black border, featuring two intersecting lines forming an \"X\" symbol at the center.\n[241, 2269]; icon: The icon has three horizontal lines, each with different shades of gray or black.\n[269, 507]; icon: The Movies app logo on my iPhone has a white \"MOVIES\" text with black background, outlined by a thin gray border.\n[88, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[536, 1395]; icon: This is an icon.\n[1010, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new information relevant to the user's request about the latest horror movie currently in theaters was found in this screenshot. The existing important notes remain unchanged.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 492, 'y': 241, 'text': '90210'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type the ZIP code \"90210\" (a commonly used ZIP code for Beverly Hills), and execute the search to refine the results for horror movies in theaters in that area. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to refine the search by entering the ZIP code \"90210.\" However, the text entered into the search bar was incorrect, resulting in \"horror movie90210s in theater\" instead of the intended query. This typo likely caused the search to fail, as no relevant results were displayed.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 245, 'text': 'horror movies in theaters 90210'}} | Description: This action will tap the \"x\" icon to clear the current text in the search bar, type the corrected query \"horror movies in theaters 90210,\" and execute the search to refine the results for horror movies currently in theaters in the specified ZIP code. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 246}} | Description: This action will tap the \"x\" icon to clear the current search query, allowing me to enter a broader query without the ZIP code. This should help in finding the latest horror movies in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'latest horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movies,\" and execute the search to find the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"latest horror movies\" was entered into the search bar, but no results were displayed. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating that the search did not yield any relevant results. This could be due to an issue with the search query, the app's functionality, or a lack of data for the requested content.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 482, 'y': 242, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies,\" and execute the search. This broader query may yield results for horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to type \"horror movies\" into the search bar, but the input was garbled, resulting in \"latest horrorhorror movies mo\\\" being entered. This likely caused the search to fail, as the query was not properly formatted. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating no progress was made.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 245, 'text': 'horror movies in theaters 90210'}} | Description: This action will tap the \"x\" icon to clear the current text in the search bar, type the corrected query \"horror movies in theaters 90210,\" and execute the search to refine the results for horror movies currently in theaters in the specified ZIP code. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 246}} | Description: This action will tap the \"x\" icon to clear the current search query, allowing me to enter a broader query without the ZIP code. This should help in finding the latest horror movies in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'latest horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movies,\" and execute the search to find the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"latest horror movies\" was entered into the search bar, but no results were displayed. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating that the search did not yield any relevant results. This could be due to an issue with the search query, the app's functionality, or a lack of data for the requested content.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 482, 'y': 242, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies,\" and execute the search. This broader query may yield results for horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to type \"horror movies\" into the search bar, but the input was garbled, resulting in \"latest horrorhorror movies mo\\\" being entered. This likely caused the search to fail, as the query was not properly formatted. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating no progress was made.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"x\" icon to clear the garbled text in the search bar, preparing it for a new, properly formatted query. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[92, 42]; text: 2:13\n[483, 213]; text: ZIP CODE, MOVIE, OR THEATER\n[923, 245]; text: x\n[121, 250]; text: V\n[543, 264]; text: atest horror movies in theaters\n[811, 509]; text: THEATERS\n[269, 510]; text: MOVIES\n[537, 1396]; text: No Theater results.\n[544, 2269]; text: O\n[242, 2270]; text: III\n[852, 2270]; text: <\n[921, 243]; icon: This is an icon.\n[123, 250]; icon: This is an icon.\n[543, 2268]; icon: This is an icon.\n[964, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[847, 2268]; icon: The icon is shaped like an arrow pointing to the left, with a blue background and white outline.\n[927, 41]; icon: The Wi-Fi symbol is composed of three lines stacked on top of each other, with two diagonal arrows pointing up and down at either end, all enclosed within a circle. The background color is white while the line colors vary between black or gray depending on whether it's connected to internet or not.\n[140, 42]; icon: The icon is a circle with a white clock face, black hands, and a red heart symbol in the center.\n[809, 507]; icon: The icon is a white capital letter \"T\" with a blue outline, representing theaters or theatre.\n[161, 42]; icon: The icon is a white circle with a black line through it, commonly known as a \"close\" or \"cancel\" symbol.\n[91, 42]; icon: The time icon on the phone screen has a white background with black text displaying \"2:13\".\n[241, 2269]; icon: The icon has three horizontal lines, each with different shades of gray or black.\n[269, 507]; icon: The Movies app logo on my iPhone has a white \"MOVIES\" text with black background, outlined by a thin gray border.\n[536, 1395]; icon: This is an icon.\n[209, 42]; icon: The icon is a white heart inside a blue circle with a gray border.\n[1010, 42]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, white in color, and depicts two overlapping rings.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new information relevant to the user's request about the latest horror movie currently in theaters was found in this screenshot. The existing important notes remain unchanged.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 246}} | Description: This action will tap the \"x\" icon to clear the current search query, allowing me to enter a broader query without the ZIP code. This should help in finding the latest horror movies in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'latest horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movies,\" and execute the search to find the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"latest horror movies\" was entered into the search bar, but no results were displayed. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating that the search did not yield any relevant results. This could be due to an issue with the search query, the app's functionality, or a lack of data for the requested content.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 482, 'y': 242, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies,\" and execute the search. This broader query may yield results for horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to type \"horror movies\" into the search bar, but the input was garbled, resulting in \"latest horrorhorror movies mo\\\" being entered. This likely caused the search to fail, as the query was not properly formatted. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating no progress was made.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"x\" icon to clear the garbled text in the search bar, preparing it for a new, properly formatted query. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'latest horror movies in theaters'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movies in theaters,\" and execute the search to find the latest horror movies currently playing in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"latest horror movies in theaters\" was entered into the search bar, but no results were displayed. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating that the search did not yield any relevant results. This could be due to an issue with the query, such as it being too broad or not properly formatted for the Fandango search engine.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The user has access to the Fandango app, which can be used to search for the latest horror movies currently in theaters. - The user also has access to the Lemon8 app, which can be used to check reviews for the identified movie.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'latest horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movies,\" and execute the search to find the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"latest horror movies\" was entered into the search bar, but no results were displayed. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating that the search did not yield any relevant results. This could be due to an issue with the search query, the app's functionality, or a lack of data for the requested content.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 482, 'y': 242, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies,\" and execute the search. This broader query may yield results for horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to type \"horror movies\" into the search bar, but the input was garbled, resulting in \"latest horrorhorror movies mo\\\" being entered. This likely caused the search to fail, as the query was not properly formatted. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating no progress was made.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"x\" icon to clear the garbled text in the search bar, preparing it for a new, properly formatted query. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'latest horror movies in theaters'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movies in theaters,\" and execute the search to find the latest horror movies currently playing in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"latest horror movies in theaters\" was entered into the search bar, but no results were displayed. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating that the search did not yield any relevant results. This could be due to an issue with the query, such as it being too broad or not properly formatted for the Fandango search engine.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to open a web browser or Google app to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The user has access to the Fandango app, which can be used to search for the latest horror movies currently in theaters.  - The user also has access to the Lemon8 app, which can be used to check reviews for the identified movie.  - The current search query in the Fandango app is \"atest horror movies in theaters,\" which appears to be a typo. The search returned \"No Theater results.\"\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 482, 'y': 242, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies,\" and execute the search. This broader query may yield results for horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to type \"horror movies\" into the search bar, but the input was garbled, resulting in \"latest horrorhorror movies mo\\\" being entered. This likely caused the search to fail, as the query was not properly formatted. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating no progress was made.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"x\" icon to clear the garbled text in the search bar, preparing it for a new, properly formatted query. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'latest horror movies in theaters'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movies in theaters,\" and execute the search to find the latest horror movies currently playing in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"latest horror movies in theaters\" was entered into the search bar, but no results were displayed. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating that the search did not yield any relevant results. This could be due to an issue with the query, such as it being too broad or not properly formatted for the Fandango search engine.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to open a web browser or Google app to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Fandango'}} | Description: This action will open the Fandango app, allowing me to search for the latest horror movies currently playing in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The user has access to the Fandango app, which can be used to search for the latest horror movies currently in theaters.  - The user also has access to the Lemon8 app, which can be used to check reviews for the identified movie.  - The current search query in the Fandango app is \"atest horror movies in theaters,\" which appears to be a typo. The search returned \"No Theater results.\"  - The search bar in the Fandango app is now cleared and ready for a corrected query.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"x\" icon to clear the garbled text in the search bar, preparing it for a new, properly formatted query. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'latest horror movies in theaters'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movies in theaters,\" and execute the search to find the latest horror movies currently playing in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"latest horror movies in theaters\" was entered into the search bar, but no results were displayed. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating that the search did not yield any relevant results. This could be due to an issue with the query, such as it being too broad or not properly formatted for the Fandango search engine.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to open a web browser or Google app to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Fandango'}} | Description: This action will open the Fandango app, allowing me to search for the latest horror movies currently playing in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"x\" icon to clear the current text in the search bar, preparing it for the correct query to be entered. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[90, 42]; text: 2:17\n[481, 238]; text: ZIP CODE, MOVIE, OR THEATER\nhorror movies 2023\n[924, 245]; text: x\n[121, 250]; text: Y\n[811, 507]; text: THEATERS\n[269, 510]; text: MOVIES\n[537, 1396]; text: No Theater results.\n[544, 2269]; text: O\n[242, 2270]; text: III\n[852, 2270]; text: <\n[921, 243]; icon: The icon is a white circle with a red \"x\" in it, indicating a close or cancel action.\n[124, 250]; icon: The arrow icon on the left side of the screen points to the left, with its head slightly angled upwards, colored blue against a white background.\n[543, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black border, and has two small dots inside representing app launchers on a smartphone home screen.\n[207, 42]; icon: The icon is a white heart inside a blue circle with a gray border.\n[964, 41]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, filled with white lines representing radio waves or Wi-Fi signals against a black background.\n[160, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[90, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[927, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[847, 2268]; icon: The icon is shaped like an arrow pointing to the left, with a blue background and white outline.\n[140, 41]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black border, featuring two intersecting lines for \"2\" minutes and red heart symbolizing \"L\".\n[809, 507]; icon: The icon is a white capital letter \"T\" with a blue outline, representing theaters or theatre.\n[241, 2269]; icon: This is an icon.\n[269, 507]; icon: The Movies app logo on my iPhone has a white \"MOVIES\" text with black background, outlined by a thin gray border.\n[536, 1395]; icon: The icon is a white square with a black outline of a movie camera.\n[1010, 42]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, white in color, and depicts two overlapping rings.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The user has access to the Fandango app, which can be used to search for the latest horror movies currently in theaters.  - The user also has access to the Lemon8 app, which can be used to check reviews for the identified movie.  - The current search query in the Fandango app is \"atest horror movies in theaters,\" which appears to be a typo. The search returned \"No Theater results.\"  - The search bar in the Fandango app is now cleared and ready for a corrected query.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

This refined query should provide a list of current horror movies in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"horror movies 2023\" was entered into the search bar, but no results were displayed. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating that the search did not yield any relevant results. This could be due to an incorrect query, a lack of data for the specified search term, or a technical issue with the app.\n- Attempt: Action: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 481, 'y': 238, 'text': 'latest horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movies,\" and execute the search.

As a result, the search did not yield any results, and the screen remains unchanged with \"No Theater results.\"\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded. The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[91, 41]; text: 2:18\n[482, 213]; text: ZIP CODE, MOVIE, OR THEATER\n[923, 244]; text: x\n[121, 250]; text: Y\n[543, 265]; text: rror movilatest horror moviese\n[811, 509]; text: THEATERS\n[269, 510]; text: MOVIES\n[537, 1396]; text: No Theater results.\n[544, 2269]; text: O\n[242, 2270]; text: III\n[852, 2270]; text: <\n[921, 243]; icon: This is an icon.\n[123, 250]; icon: The icon is shaped like an arrow pointing to the left, with blue fill color inside its white outline on a transparent background.\n[543, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black border, and has two small dots inside representing app launchers on a smartphone home screen.\n[964, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[847, 2268]; icon: The icon is shaped like an arrow pointing to the left, with a blue background and white outline.\n[927, 41]; icon: The Wi-Fi symbol is composed of three lines stacked on top of each other, with two diagonal arrows pointing up and down at either end, all enclosed within a circle. The background color is white while the line colors vary between black or gray depending on whether it's connected to internet or not.\n[141, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[809, 507]; icon: This is an icon.\n[210, 42]; icon: The icon is a heart symbol with a white outline on a red background, enclosed within a blue circle.\n[241, 2269]; icon: The icon has three horizontal lines, each with different shades of gray or black.\n[269, 507]; icon: This is an icon.\n[163, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[92, 42]; icon: The time icon on the phone screen has a white background with black text displaying \"2:18\".\n[536, 1395]; icon: The icon is a white square with a black outline of a movie camera.\n[1010, 42]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, white in color, and depicts two overlapping rings.\n[116, 41]; icon: The number \"8\" is displayed in white on a black background, with a rounded rectangular outline.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The user has access to the Fandango app, which can be used to search for the latest horror movies currently in theaters.  - The user also has access to the Lemon8 app, which can be used to check reviews for the identified movie.  - The current search query in the Fandango app is \"atest horror movies in theaters,\" which appears to be a typo. The search returned \"No Theater results.\"  - The search bar in the Fandango app is now cleared and ready for a corrected query.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to open a web browser or Google app to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Fandango'}} | Description: This action will open the Fandango app, allowing me to search for the latest horror movies currently playing in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"x\" icon to clear the current text in the search bar, preparing it for the correct query to be entered. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'horror movies 2023'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies 2023,\" and execute the search. This refined query should provide a list of current horror movies in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"horror movies 2023\" was entered into the search bar, but no results were displayed. The screen still shows \"No Theater results,\" indicating that the search did not yield any relevant results. This could be due to an incorrect query, a lack of data for the specified search term, or a technical issue with the app.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 481, 'y': 238, 'text': 'latest horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movies,\" and execute the search. This refined query should provide a list of current horror movies in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The intended query, \"latest horror movies,\" was not correctly entered into the search bar. Instead, the text \"rror movilatest horror moviese\" was entered, likely due to a typing error. As a result, the search did not yield any results, and the screen remains unchanged with \"No Theater results.\"\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",
