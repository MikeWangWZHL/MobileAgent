The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[99, 43]; text: 4:33\n[161, 432]; text: Settings\n[664, 431]; text: Notes\n[916, 431]; text: Clock\n[413, 432]; text: Contacts\n[913, 758]; text: Gallery\n[161, 757]; text: Chrome\n[665, 756]; text: YouTube\n[413, 759]; text: Google\n[914, 966]; text: m\n[664, 967]; text: 31\n[162, 1084]; text: Maps\n[416, 1085]; text: Gmail\n[664, 1084]; text: Calendar\n[915, 1084]; text: McDonald's\n[161, 1412]; text: Amazon Shopping\n[414, 1410]; text: Walmart\n[663, 1412]; text: Best Buy\n[916, 1412]; text: Tripadvisor\n[663, 1618]; text: 8\n[913, 1618]; text: Booking\n[164, 1613]; text: Lemon8\n[914, 1737]; text: Booking.com\n[415, 1739]; text: X\n[662, 1738]; text: Fandango\n[161, 1737]; text: Lemon8\n[202, 2077]; text: c\n[251, 2271]; text: III\n[852, 2267]; text: <\n[543, 2269]; text: \u25cb\n[870, 2077]; icon: This is an icon.\n[413, 314]; icon: The icon is round with a red background, white outline around the edge, and a person's silhouette inside it.\n[914, 314]; icon: This is an icon.\n[914, 1294]; icon: The app logo shows a green circle with black outlines around it, inside which there's a white owl facing to the right.\n[163, 641]; icon: This is an icon.\n[413, 967]; icon: The app logo, shaped like a circle with rounded corners, features two overlapping \"M\"s colored red on top and green at bottom.\n[664, 967]; icon: The app logo is circle with blue background, white number thirty-one inside it, and red and green lines around outside edge.\n[413, 1294]; icon: The app logo has seven yellow petals on blue background, forming a circle.\n[413, 641]; icon: The Google app logo on Android devices has been simplified to just its letter \"G\" with rounded edges, colored yellow at the top transitioning into blue at the bottom.\n[663, 315]; icon: This is an icon.\n[203, 2077]; icon: This is an icon.\n[163, 315]; icon: This is an icon.\n[537, 2076]; icon: The app logo has two overlapping blue speech bubbles with a gray background, forming a circle at the bottom.\n[163, 1293]; icon: The Amazon logo, which appears as a brown smiley face with green lines on its forehead, is enclosed within a white square.\n[914, 641]; icon: The app logo is circular with a pink background, white border, and a flower graphic at its center.\n[163, 967]; icon: The app logo is circular with a white background, featuring a green pin that has blue and red stripes around it.\n[163, 1621]; icon: The icon is round, yellow with black text that reads \"lemon8\".\n[664, 640]; icon: The app logo is a red play button with a white outline, set against a gray background that resembles a circle.\n[663, 1294]; icon: The icon is round, yellow with blue border and has white text inside that says \"Tag\".\n[663, 1621]; icon: The app logo is orange with white text that says \"F\" inside it, enclosed by a black circle.\n[914, 968]; icon: The logo is shaped like two arcs with three legs, colored red on top and yellow at bottom.\n[913, 1620]; icon: The icon is round, blue with white text that says \"Booking\".\n[413, 1620]; icon: The icon is shaped like an \"X\" and is black with a white outline.\n[413, 1621]; icon: The icon is shaped like a letter X, outlined with white lines against a black background.\n[662, 315]; icon: The app logo is a white book with red pages on top, placed against a solid background of bright red.\n[659, 1293]; icon: This is an icon.\n[162, 314]; icon: The icon is circular with multiple gray cogs inside it, bordered by a white outline on a blue background.\n[161, 966]; icon: This is an icon.\n[664, 967]; icon: This is an icon.\n[871, 2076]; icon: This is an icon.\n[202, 2076]; icon: This is an icon.\n[964, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[543, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, outlined with a thin black border, filled with grayish-white color inside.\n[160, 1234]; icon: The icon is a square with green stripes on a white background.\n[414, 965]; icon: The icon is a white \"M\" with red outline, depicting Gmail app logo on a blue background.\n[913, 638]; icon: The icon is shaped like a flower with six petals, all colored white except for the center which is pinkish-purple.\n[412, 1291]; icon: The icon is shaped like a hexagon with rounded corners, and it has a yellow background with a black outline.\n[539, 2081]; icon: The icon is shaped like two blue speech bubbles overlapping each other, with the top bubble slightly smaller than the bottom one.\n[913, 1294]; icon: The logo for TripAdvisor, which features two white eyes outlined in black on a green background.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome browser, allowing me to perform a search for a Chinese-style recipe using onions, beef, and potatoes. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome browser, allowing me to perform a search for a Chinese-style recipe using onions, beef, and potatoes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 400, 'text': 'Chinese recipe with onions beef potatoes under 1 hour'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type the query \"Chinese recipe with onions beef potatoes under 1 hour,\" and execute the search to find relevant results. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"Chinese recipe with onions beef potatoes under 1 hour\" was expected to be entered into the search bar, but the screen after the action shows no evidence of the query being executed or any search results related to the query. The screen remains on the default Google homepage with unrelated content.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Several relevant video tutorials for Chinese-style recipes using onions, beef, and potatoes have been identified:  1. **\"Beef and Onion Stir-Fry - Easy and Delicious Beef...\"**    - Platform: YouTube (Phong's Kitchen)    - Duration: 1:14    - Posted: 1 day ago   2. **\"Secret to Making Super Tender Beef & Onion Stir...\"**    - Platform: YouTube (Spice N' Pans)    - Duration: 9:08    - Posted: Feb 16, 2024   3. **\"Beef stew with potatoes Chinese style recipe \u571f\u8c46...\"**    - Platform: YouTube (Taste of Asian Food)    - Duration: 7:21    - Posted: Feb 16, 2024   4. **\"Beef And Onion Stir Fry - Tender And Juicy...\"**    - Platform: YouTube (Delicious and simple meals)    - Duration: 51:48    - Posted: 2 weeks ago  - The next step is to select one of these videos and stop at the screen displaying the tutorial.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome browser, allowing me to perform a search for a Chinese-style recipe using onions, beef, and potatoes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 400, 'text': 'Chinese recipe with onions beef potatoes under 1 hour'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type the query \"Chinese recipe with onions beef potatoes under 1 hour,\" and execute the search to find relevant results. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"Chinese recipe with onions beef potatoes under 1 hour\" was expected to be entered into the search bar, but the screen after the action shows no evidence of the query being executed or any search results related to the query. The screen remains on the default Google homepage with unrelated content.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 400, 'y': 156, 'text': 'Chinese recipe with onions beef potatoes under 1 hour'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type the query \"Chinese recipe with onions beef potatoes under 1 hour,\" and execute the search to find relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

Check if there are any subgoals that are accomplished by a sequence of successful actions and can be consolidated into new \"Shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions. For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",
