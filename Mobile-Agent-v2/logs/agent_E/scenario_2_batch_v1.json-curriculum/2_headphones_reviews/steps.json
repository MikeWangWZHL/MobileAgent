Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new important notes to record.

If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new important notes to record. Proceeding with the task to locate and review three detailed user reviews for the Bose QC45 headphones.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 161, 'y': 1412}} | Description: I will tap on the Amazon Shopping app icon to open it and proceed with the task of finding reviews for the Bose QC45 headphones. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 310, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Bose QC45 headphones'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Bose QC45 headphones,\" and press Enter to initiate the search for the product on Amazon. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**. - Key features highlighted:  - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.  - Includes a microphone.  - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.  - Color: Black. - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**. - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.  Proceeding to locate and analyze three detailed user reviews.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 161, 'y': 1412}} | Description: I will tap on the Amazon Shopping app icon to open it and proceed with the task of finding reviews for the Bose QC45 headphones. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 310, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Bose QC45 headphones'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Bose QC45 headphones,\" and press Enter to initiate the search for the product on Amazon. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 507, 'y': 1888}} | Description: I will tap on the Bose QC45 headphones product listing to navigate to its page and access the reviews section.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**.  - Key features highlighted:   - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.   - Includes a microphone.   - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.   - Color: Black.  - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**.  - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.  - Current price: **$199.00** (43% off from the list price of $349.00).  - Available colors: **Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac**.  - All colors are **in stock**.  Proceeding to locate and analyze three detailed user reviews for the product.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 161, 'y': 1412}} | Description: I will tap on the Amazon Shopping app icon to open it and proceed with the task of finding reviews for the Bose QC45 headphones. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 310, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Bose QC45 headphones'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Bose QC45 headphones,\" and press Enter to initiate the search for the product on Amazon. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 507, 'y': 1888}} | Description: I will tap on the Bose QC45 headphones product listing to navigate to its page and access the reviews section. This will allow me to locate and analyze detailed user reviews. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll down and locate the reviews section for the Bose QC45 headphones. This will allow me to access and analyze detailed user reviews. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**.  - Key features highlighted:   - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.   - Includes a microphone.   - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.   - Color: Black.  - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**.  - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.  - Current price: **$199.00** (43% off from the list price of $349.00).  - Available colors: **Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac**.  - All colors are **in stock**.  - **FREE Returns** and **FREE delivery** are available, with delivery by **Tuesday, December 17**.  - The product will **arrive before Christmas**.  - Ships from **Adorama**.  Proceeding to locate and analyze three detailed user reviews for the product.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 161, 'y': 1412}} | Description: I will tap on the Amazon Shopping app icon to open it and proceed with the task of finding reviews for the Bose QC45 headphones. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 310, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Bose QC45 headphones'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Bose QC45 headphones,\" and press Enter to initiate the search for the product on Amazon. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 507, 'y': 1888}} | Description: I will tap on the Bose QC45 headphones product listing to navigate to its page and access the reviews section.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**.  - Key features highlighted:   - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.   - Includes a microphone.   - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.   - Color: Black.  - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**.  - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.  - Current price: **$199.00** (43% off from the list price of $349.00).  - Available colors: **Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac**.  - All colors are **in stock**.  - **FREE Returns** and **FREE delivery** are available, with delivery by **Tuesday, December 17**.  - The product will **arrive before Christmas**.  - Ships from **Adorama**.  - Returnable until **January 31, 2025**.  - A **2-Year Protection Plan** is available for **$28.99**.  - Other sellers offer the product starting at **$161.00** (+ $4.99 shipping).  Proceeding to locate and analyze three detailed user reviews for the product.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 310, 'y': 169, 'text': 'Bose QC45 headphones'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Bose QC45 headphones,\" and press Enter to initiate the search for the product on Amazon. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 507, 'y': 1888}} | Description: I will tap on the Bose QC45 headphones product listing to navigate to its page and access the reviews section.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**.   - Key features highlighted:    - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.    - Includes a microphone.    - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.    - Color: Black.   - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**.   - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.   - Current price: **$199.00** (43% off from the list price of $349.00).   - Available colors: **Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac**.   - All colors are **in stock**.   - **FREE Returns** and **FREE delivery** are available, with delivery by **Tuesday, December 17**.   - The product will **arrive before Christmas**.   - Ships from **Adorama**.   - Returnable until **January 31, 2025**.   - A **2-Year Protection Plan** is available for **$28.99**.   - Other sellers offer the product starting at **$161.00** (+ $4.99 shipping).

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page and locate the reviews section for the Bose QC45 headphones.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**.  - Key features highlighted:   - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.   - Includes a microphone.   - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.   - Color: Black.  - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**.  - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.  - Current price: **$199.00** (43% off from the list price of $349.00).  - Available colors: **Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac**.  - All colors are **in stock**.  - **FREE Returns** and **FREE delivery** are available, with delivery by **Tuesday, December 17**.  - The product will **arrive before Christmas**.  - Ships from **Adorama**.  - Returnable until **January 31, 2025**.  - A **2-Year Protection Plan** is available for **$28.99**.  - Other sellers offer the product starting at **$161.00** (+ $4.99 shipping).  - **Top Highlights**:   - **Brand**: Bose   - **Color**: Black   - **Ear Placement**: Over Ear   - **Form Factor**: Over Ear   - **Noise Control**: Active Noise Cancellation   - **Model Name**: Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, Bluetooth Over  - The reviews section is not yet visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**.  - Key features highlighted:   - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.   - Includes a microphone.   - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.   - Color: Black.  - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**.  - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.  - Current price: **$199.00** (43% off from the list price of $349.00).  - Available colors: **Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac**.  - All colors are **in stock**.  - **FREE Returns** and **FREE delivery** are available, with delivery by **Tuesday, December 17**.  - The product will **arrive before Christmas**.  - Ships from **Adorama**.  - Returnable until **January 31, 2025**.  - A **2-Year Protection Plan** is available for **$28.99**.  - Other sellers offer the product starting at **$161.00** (+ $4.99 shipping).  - **Top Highlights**:   - **Brand**: Bose   - **Color**: Black   - **Ear Placement**: Over Ear   - **Form Factor**: Over Ear   - **Noise Control**: Active Noise Cancellation   - **Model Name**: Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, Bluetooth Over  - The reviews section is not yet visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**.  - Key features highlighted:   - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.   - Includes a microphone.   - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.   - Color: Black.  - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**.  - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.  - Current price: **$199.00** (43% off from the list price of $349.00).  - Available colors: **Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac**.  - All colors are **in stock**.  - **FREE Returns** and **FREE delivery** are available, with delivery by **Tuesday, December 17**.  - The product will **arrive before Christmas**.  - Ships from **Adorama**.  - Returnable until **January 31, 2025**.  - A **2-Year Protection Plan** is available for **$28.99**.  - Other sellers offer the product starting at **$161.00** (+ $4.99 shipping).  - **Top Highlights**:   - **Brand**: Bose   - **Color**: Black   - **Ear Placement**: Over Ear   - **Form Factor**: Over Ear   - **Noise Control**: Active Noise Cancellation   - **Model Name**: Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, Bluetooth Over  - The reviews section is not yet visible.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page and locate the reviews section for the Bose QC45 headphones.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**.  - Key features highlighted:   - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.   - Includes a microphone.   - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.   - Color: Black.  - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**.  - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.  - Current price: **$199.00** (43% off from the list price of $349.00).  - Available colors: **Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac**.  - All colors are **in stock**.  - **FREE Returns** and **FREE delivery** are available, with delivery by **Tuesday, December 17**.  - The product will **arrive before Christmas**.  - Ships from **Adorama**.  - Returnable until **January 31, 2025**.  - A **2-Year Protection Plan** is available for **$28.99**.  - Other sellers offer the product starting at **$161.00** (+ $4.99 shipping).  - **Top Highlights**:   - **Brand**: Bose   - **Color**: Black   - **Ear Placement**: Over Ear   - **Form Factor**: Over Ear   - **Noise Control**: Active Noise Cancellation   - **Model Name**: Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, Bluetooth Over  - The reviews section is not yet visible.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page and locate the reviews section for the Bose QC45 headphones.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**.  - Key features highlighted:   - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.   - Includes a microphone.   - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.   - Color: Black.  - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**.  - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.  - Current price: **$199.00** (43% off from the list price of $349.00).  - Available colors: **Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac**.  - All colors are **in stock**.  - **FREE Returns** and **FREE delivery** are available, with delivery by **Tuesday, December 17**.  - The product will **arrive before Christmas**.  - Ships from **Adorama**.  - Returnable until **January 31, 2025**.  - A **2-Year Protection Plan** is available for **$28.99**.  - Other sellers offer the product starting at **$161.00** (+ $4.99 shipping).  - **Top Highlights**:   - **Brand**: Bose   - **Color**: Black   - **Ear Placement**: Over Ear   - **Form Factor**: Over Ear   - **Noise Control**: Active Noise Cancellation   - **Model Name**: Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, Bluetooth Over  - The reviews section is not yet visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**.  - Key features highlighted:   - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.   - Includes a microphone.   - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.   - Color: Black.  - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**.  - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.  - Current price: **$199.00** (43% off from the list price of $349.00).  - Available colors: **Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac**.  - All colors are **in stock**.  - **FREE Returns** and **FREE delivery** are available, with delivery by **Tuesday, December 17**.  - The product will **arrive before Christmas**.  - Ships from **Adorama**.  - Returnable until **January 31, 2025**.  - A **2-Year Protection Plan** is available for **$28.99**.  - Other sellers offer the product starting at **$161.00** (+ $4.99 shipping).  - **Top Highlights**:   - **Brand**: Bose   - **Color**: Black   - **Ear Placement**: Over Ear   - **Form Factor**: Over Ear   - **Noise Control**: Active Noise Cancellation   - **Model Name**: Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, Bluetooth Over  - The reviews section is not yet visible.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**.  - Key features highlighted:   - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.   - Includes a microphone.   - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.   - Color: Black.  - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**.  - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.  - Current price: **$199.00** (43% off from the list price of $349.00).  - Available colors: **Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac**.  - All colors are **in stock**.  - **FREE Returns** and **FREE delivery** are available, with delivery by **Tuesday, December 17**.  - The product will **arrive before Christmas**.  - Ships from **Adorama**.  - Returnable until **January 31, 2025**.  - A **2-Year Protection Plan** is available for **$28.99**.  - Other sellers offer the product starting at **$161.00** (+ $4.99 shipping).  - **Top Highlights**:   - **Brand**: Bose   - **Color**: Black   - **Ear Placement**: Over Ear   - **Form Factor**: Over Ear   - **Noise Control**: Active Noise Cancellation   - **Model Name**: Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, Bluetooth Over  - The reviews section is not yet visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**.  - Key features highlighted:   - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.   - Includes a microphone.   - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.   - Color: Black.  - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**.  - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.  - Current price: **$199.00** (43% off from the list price of $349.00).  - Available colors: **Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac**.  - All colors are **in stock**.  - **FREE Returns** and **FREE delivery** are available, with delivery by **Tuesday, December 17**.  - The product will **arrive before Christmas**.  - Ships from **Adorama**.  - Returnable until **January 31, 2025**.  - A **2-Year Protection Plan** is available for **$28.99**.  - Other sellers offer the product starting at **$161.00** (+ $4.99 shipping).  - **Top Highlights**:   - **Brand**: Bose   - **Color**: Black   - **Ear Placement**: Over Ear   - **Form Factor**: Over Ear   - **Noise Control**: Active Noise Cancellation   - **Model Name**: Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, Bluetooth Over  - The reviews section is not yet visible.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**.  - Key features highlighted:   - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.   - Includes a microphone.   - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.   - Color: Black.  - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**.  - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.  - Current price: **$199.00** (43% off from the list price of $349.00).  - Available colors: **Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac**.  - All colors are **in stock**.  - **FREE Returns** and **FREE delivery** are available, with delivery by **Tuesday, December 17**.  - The product will **arrive before Christmas**.  - Ships from **Adorama**.  - Returnable until **January 31, 2025**.  - A **2-Year Protection Plan** is available for **$28.99**.  - Other sellers offer the product starting at **$161.00** (+ $4.99 shipping).  - **Top Highlights**:   - **Brand**: Bose   - **Color**: Black   - **Ear Placement**: Over Ear   - **Form Factor**: Over Ear   - **Noise Control**: Active Noise Cancellation   - **Model Name**: Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, Bluetooth Over  - The reviews section is not yet visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**.  - Key features highlighted:   - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.   - Includes a microphone.   - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.   - Color: Black.  - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**.  - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.  - Current price: **$199.00** (43% off from the list price of $349.00).  - Available colors: **Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac**.  - All colors are **in stock**.  - **FREE Returns** and **FREE delivery** are available, with delivery by **Tuesday, December 17**.  - The product will **arrive before Christmas**.  - Ships from **Adorama**.  - Returnable until **January 31, 2025**.  - A **2-Year Protection Plan** is available for **$28.99**.  - Other sellers offer the product starting at **$161.00** (+ $4.99 shipping).  - **Top Highlights**:   - **Brand**: Bose   - **Color**: Black   - **Ear Placement**: Over Ear   - **Form Factor**: Over Ear   - **Noise Control**: Active Noise Cancellation   - **Model Name**: Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, Bluetooth Over  - The reviews section is not yet visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12.

The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12. Always stop at the final screen requested by the user, ensuring the task is fully completed before ending the interaction.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The product being reviewed is the **Bose QuietComfort 45 (QC45) Bluetooth Headphones**.  - Key features highlighted:   - Wireless, over-ear noise-canceling headphones.   - Includes a microphone.   - Offers up to 24 hours of battery life.   - Color: Black.  - The product has a **4.5-star rating** based on **6,983 reviews**.  - It is a popular product with **10K+ units sold in the past month**.  - Current price: **$199.00** (43% off from the list price of $349.00).  - Available colors: **Black, Blue Dusk, Chilled Lilac**.  - All colors are **in stock**.  - **FREE Returns** and **FREE delivery** are available, with delivery by **Tuesday, December 17**.  - The product will **arrive before Christmas**.  - Ships from **Adorama**.  - Returnable until **January 31, 2025**.  - A **2-Year Protection Plan** is available for **$28.99**.  - Other sellers offer the product starting at **$161.00** (+ $4.99 shipping).  - **Top Highlights**:   - **Brand**: Bose   - **Color**: Black   - **Ear Placement**: Over Ear   - **Form Factor**: Over Ear   - **Noise Control**: Active Noise Cancellation   - **Model Name**: Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, Bluetooth Over  - The reviews section is not yet visible.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page. This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section for the Bose QC45 headphones. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section for the Bose QC45 headphones. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 1001, 'y': 1295}} | Description: I will tap the \">\" icon next to the \"Customer reviews\" section to open the detailed reviews page. This action is expected to display individual user reviews for further analysis. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is completely black, indicating that the expected detailed reviews page did not load. This could be due to a loading issue, a misinterpretation of the tap action, or a technical glitch.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to display individual user reviews for further analysis. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is completely black, indicating that the expected detailed reviews page did not load. This could be due to a loading issue, a misinterpretation of the tap action, or a technical glitch.\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will use the \"Back\" action to return to the previous screen and recover from the black screen issue. This will allow me to retry accessing the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page. This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section for the Bose QC45 headphones. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page. This action is expected to reveal more content, including the reviews section for the Bose QC45 headphones. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 1001, 'y': 1295}} | Description: I will tap the \">\" icon next to the \"Customer reviews\" section to open the detailed reviews page. This action is expected to display individual user reviews for further analysis. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is completely black, indicating that the expected detailed reviews page did not load. This could be due to a loading issue, a misinterpretation of the tap action, or a technical glitch.\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will use the \"Back\" action to return to the previous screen and recover from the black screen issue. This will allow me to retry accessing the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 1003, 'y': 1296}} | Description: I will tap the \">\" icon next to the \"Customer reviews\" section to open the detailed reviews page. This action is expected to display individual user reviews for further analysis. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is completely black, indicating that the expected detailed reviews page did not load or display. This could be due to a loading issue, a misinterpretation of the tap action, or a technical glitch.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to scroll further down the product page.

This action is expected to display individual user reviews for further analysis. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is completely black, indicating that the expected detailed reviews page did not load. This could be due to a loading issue, a misinterpretation of the tap action, or a technical glitch.\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will use the \"Back\" action to return to the previous screen and recover from the black screen issue. This will allow me to retry accessing the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 1003, 'y': 1296}} | Description: I will tap the \">\" icon next to the \"Customer reviews\" section to open the detailed reviews page.

This will allow me to explore alternative ways to access the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n- Search_Location_in_Maps(x, y, text): Tap the search bar in Google Maps at position (x, y), type the location text, and select the first search result to display the route options. | Precondition: The Google Maps app is open, and the search bar is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 1001, 'y': 1295}} | Description: I will tap the \">\" icon next to the \"Customer reviews\" section to open the detailed reviews page.

This could be due to a loading issue, a misinterpretation of the tap action, or a technical glitch.\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will use the \"Back\" action to return to the previous screen and recover from the black screen issue. This will allow me to retry accessing the reviews section. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 1003, 'y': 1296}} | Description: I will tap the \">\" icon next to the \"Customer reviews\" section to open the detailed reviews page.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.  10. If a button or option does not respond to a tap, ensure it is fully visible on the screen. Use a swipe or scroll action to adjust the view if necessary before retrying.  11. When switching between apps, ensure the correct app is selected from the app switcher to avoid unnecessary navigation errors.  12.

The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.
