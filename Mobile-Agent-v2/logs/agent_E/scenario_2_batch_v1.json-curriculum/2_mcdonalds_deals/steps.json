The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[99, 41]; text: 4:39\n[161, 432]; text: Settings\n[664, 431]; text: Notes\n[916, 431]; text: Clock\n[413, 432]; text: Contacts\n[913, 758]; text: Gallery\n[161, 757]; text: Chrome\n[665, 756]; text: YouTube\n[413, 759]; text: Google\n[914, 966]; text: m\n[664, 967]; text: 31\n[162, 1084]; text: Maps\n[416, 1085]; text: Gmail\n[664, 1084]; text: Calendar\n[915, 1084]; text: McDonald's\n[161, 1412]; text: Amazon Shopping\n[414, 1410]; text: Walmart\n[663, 1412]; text: Best Buy\n[916, 1412]; text: Tripadvisor\n[663, 1618]; text: 8\n[913, 1618]; text: Booking\n[164, 1613]; text: Lemon8\n[914, 1737]; text: Booking.com\n[415, 1739]; text: X\n[662, 1738]; text: Fandango\n[161, 1737]; text: Lemon8\n[202, 2077]; text: c\n[251, 2271]; text: III\n[852, 2267]; text: <\n[543, 2269]; text: \u25cb\n[870, 2077]; icon: The app logo is circular with pink background, white border and black camera inside it.\n[413, 314]; icon: The icon is round with a red background, white outline around the edge, and a person's silhouette inside it.\n[914, 1294]; icon: This is an icon.\n[163, 641]; icon: This is an icon.\n[413, 967]; icon: This is an icon.\n[664, 967]; icon: The app logo is circle with blue background, white number thirty-one inside it, and red and green lines around outside edge.\n[914, 314]; icon: The app logo is circular with two triangles pointing upwards inside it, all in purple on a white background.\n[413, 641]; icon: The Google app logo on Android devices has been simplified to just its letter \"G\" with rounded edges, colored yellow at the top transitioning into blue at the bottom.\n[413, 1294]; icon: The app logo has seven yellow petals on blue background, forming a circle.\n[663, 315]; icon: This is an icon.\n[203, 2077]; icon: The app logo is circular with green background, white border and black letter \"C\" inside it.\n[163, 315]; icon: This is an icon.\n[537, 2076]; icon: The app logo has two blue chat bubbles overlapping each other with the top bubble slightly smaller than the bottom bubble, all enclosed within a white square.\n[163, 1293]; icon: The Amazon logo, which appears as a brown smiley face with green lines on its forehead, is enclosed within a white square.\n[914, 641]; icon: This is an icon.\n[163, 967]; icon: The app logo is circular with a white background, featuring a green pin that has blue and red stripes around it.\n[163, 1621]; icon: This is an icon.\n[664, 640]; icon: This is an icon.\n[663, 1294]; icon: This is an icon.\n[663, 1621]; icon: This is an icon.\n[914, 968]; icon: This is an icon.\n[913, 1620]; icon: The icon is round, blue with white text that says \"Booking\".\n[413, 1620]; icon: The icon is shaped like an \"X\" and is black with a white outline.\n[413, 1621]; icon: The icon is shaped like a letter X, outlined with white lines against a black background.\n[662, 315]; icon: The app logo is a white book with red pages on top, placed against a solid background of bright red.\n[659, 1293]; icon: The icon is shaped like a rectangle with rounded corners, and its background color is yellow.\n[162, 314]; icon: The icon is circular with multiple gray cogs inside it, bordered by a white outline on a blue background.\n[162, 966]; icon: The Google Maps logo, which consists of a blue circle with a white outline of a pin inside it on a black background.\n[664, 967]; icon: The app icon is a square with rounded corners, filled with blueish purple color and has white text \"31\" on it.\n[871, 2076]; icon: The app logo is circular with red fill, white border and two smaller white dots inside on top and bottom.\n[202, 2077]; icon: The icon is shaped like a green telephone with a white outline, representing communication or calling functions on a device.\n[964, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[543, 2268]; icon: This is an icon.\n[160, 1234]; icon: This is an icon.\n[414, 966]; icon: This is an icon.\n[913, 638]; icon: This is an icon.\n[412, 1291]; icon: This is an icon.\n[539, 2081]; icon: The icon is shaped like two blue speech bubbles overlapping each other, with the top bubble slightly smaller than the bottom one.\n[913, 1294]; icon: The logo is shaped like two eyes stacked on top of each other with white outlines, filled in green.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open. - The current screen highlights the McRib promotion: \"McRib is back. It's a holiday miracle & limited*.\" - There is a \"Rewards & Deals\" section available in the bottom navigation bar. - The \"Sandwiches & Meals\" category is visible in the menu section, which may include the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. - A notification badge (red circle with \"1\") is present on the bag icon, possibly indicating an active deal or reward.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 915, 'y': 1084}} | Description: This action will tap on the McDonald's app icon to open it, allowing us to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen highlights the McRib promotion: \"McRib is back. It's a holiday miracle & limited*.\"  - There is a \"Rewards & Deals\" section available in the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Sandwiches & Meals\" category is visible in the menu section, which may include the Spicy McCrispy sandwich.  - A notification badge (red circle with \"1\") is present on the bag icon, possibly indicating an active deal or reward.  - The pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\" with an option to change the location.  - The \"My Rewards\" section shows items redeemable for 4500 points, including a Large Frappe, Large French Fries, and Sausage McMuffin with Egg (not available during lunch).  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating a potential deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 915, 'y': 1084}} | Description: This action will tap on the McDonald's app icon to open it, allowing us to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 537, 'y': 2166}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Rewards & Deals\" option in the bottom navigation bar, navigating to the section where deals and rewards are displayed.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen highlights the McRib promotion: \"McRib is back.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 915, 'y': 1084}} | Description: This action will tap on the McDonald's app icon to open it, allowing us to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 537, 'y': 2166}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Rewards & Deals\" option in the bottom navigation bar, navigating to the section where deals and rewards are displayed.

This is the next step in determining if the deal can be added to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note: Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here.

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[97, 41]; text: 4:42\n[182, 263]; text: Deal\n[94, 258]; text: \u25cf\n[507, 376]; text: 40% off a McCrispyTM,\n[531, 498]; text: y McCrispyTM,\n[182, 496]; text: Spicy\n[612, 611]; text: McCrispyTM\n[208, 611]; text: Deluxe\n[378, 726]; text: or Deluxe Spicy\n[514, 837]; text: McCrispyTM (excludes\n[142, 952]; text: tax)\n[192, 1063]; text: Valid 1x/day\n[223, 1151]; text: View eligible items\n[237, 1245]; text: Expires 12/29/2024\nView terms of this offer\n[665, 1267]; text: Participating Restaurants\n[528, 1339]; text: Offer not available during Breakfast.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen highlights the McRib promotion: \"McRib is back. It's a holiday miracle & limited*.\"  - There is a \"Rewards & Deals\" section available in the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Sandwiches & Meals\" category is visible in the menu section, which may include the Spicy McCrispy sandwich.  - A notification badge (red circle with \"1\") is present on the bag icon, possibly indicating an active deal or reward.  - The pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\" with an option to change the location.  - The \"My Rewards\" section shows items redeemable for 4500 points, including a Large Frappe, Large French Fries, and Sausage McMuffin with Egg (not available during lunch).  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating a potential deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - A deal is available for \"40% off a McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).\"   - Valid once per day.   - Expires on 12/29/2024.   - Not available during breakfast or after midnight.   - Includes a \"View eligible items\" link.  - The current screen provides an option to \"Add to Mobile Order\" for the deal.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 915, 'y': 1084}} | Description: This action will tap on the McDonald's app icon to open it, allowing us to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 537, 'y': 2166}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Rewards & Deals\" option in the bottom navigation bar, navigating to the section where deals and rewards are displayed. This is the next step in checking for any offers related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 1800}} | Description: This action will tap on the Spicy McCrispy sandwich image in the \"Deals\" section to view the details of the deal. This is the next step in determining if the deal can be added to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button, adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. This is the next step in fulfilling the user's request. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is identical to the screen before the action. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was not successfully tapped, and the deal was not added to the mobile order. The potential reason could be a missed or incorrect tap on the button.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note: Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen highlights the McRib promotion: \"McRib is back. It's a holiday miracle & limited*.\"  - There is a \"Rewards & Deals\" section available in the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Sandwiches & Meals\" category is visible in the menu section, which may include the Spicy McCrispy sandwich.  - A notification badge (red circle with \"1\") is present on the bag icon, possibly indicating an active deal or reward.  - The pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\" with an option to change the location.  - The \"My Rewards\" section shows items redeemable for 4500 points, including a Large Frappe, Large French Fries, and Sausage McMuffin with Egg (not available during lunch).  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating a potential deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - A deal is available for \"40% off a McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).\"   - Valid once per day.   - Expires on 12/29/2024.   - Not available during breakfast or after midnight.   - Includes a \"View eligible items\" link.  - The current screen provides an option to \"Add to Mobile Order\" for the deal.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 915, 'y': 1084}} | Description: This action will tap on the McDonald's app icon to open it, allowing us to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 537, 'y': 2166}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Rewards & Deals\" option in the bottom navigation bar, navigating to the section where deals and rewards are displayed. This is the next step in checking for any offers related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 1800}} | Description: This action will tap on the Spicy McCrispy sandwich image in the \"Deals\" section to view the details of the deal. This is the next step in determining if the deal can be added to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button, adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. This is the next step in fulfilling the user's request. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is identical to the screen before the action. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was not successfully tapped, and the deal was not added to the mobile order. The potential reason could be a missed or incorrect tap on the button.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button again, aiming to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is identical to the screen before the action. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was tapped, but the app did not proceed to the next step in the ordering process. The action did not produce the expected behavior, possibly due to a failure in registering the tap or an issue within the app.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen highlights the McRib promotion: \"McRib is back. It's a holiday miracle & limited*.\"  - There is a \"Rewards & Deals\" section available in the bottom navigation bar.  - The \"Sandwiches & Meals\" category is visible in the menu section, which may include the Spicy McCrispy sandwich.  - A notification badge (red circle with \"1\") is present on the bag icon, possibly indicating an active deal or reward.  - The pickup location is set to \"616 E Green St.\" with an option to change the location.  - The \"My Rewards\" section shows items redeemable for 4500 points, including a Large Frappe, Large French Fries, and Sausage McMuffin with Egg (not available during lunch).  - The \"Deals\" section includes an image of the Spicy McCrispy sandwich, indicating a potential deal.  - The \"View all\" option is available for both \"My Rewards\" and \"Deals.\"  - A deal is available for \"40% off a McCrispy\u2122, Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 (excludes tax).\"   - Valid once per day.   - Expires on 12/29/2024.   - Not available during breakfast or after midnight.   - Includes a \"View eligible items\" link.  - The current screen provides an option to \"Add to Mobile Order\" for the deal.  - The deal is for Spicy McCrispy\u2122, Deluxe McCrispy\u2122, or Deluxe Spicy McCrispy\u2122 sandwiches.  - The \"Add to Mobile Order\" button is visible and accessible.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 537, 'y': 2166}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Rewards & Deals\" option in the bottom navigation bar, navigating to the section where deals and rewards are displayed. This is the next step in checking for any offers related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 1800}} | Description: This action will tap on the Spicy McCrispy sandwich image in the \"Deals\" section to view the details of the deal. This is the next step in determining if the deal can be added to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button, adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. This is the next step in fulfilling the user's request. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is identical to the screen before the action. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was not successfully tapped, and the deal was not added to the mobile order. The potential reason could be a missed or incorrect tap on the button.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button again, aiming to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is identical to the screen before the action. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was tapped, but the app did not proceed to the next step in the ordering process. The action did not produce the expected behavior, possibly due to a failure in registering the tap or an issue within the app.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1800, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 1600}} | Description: This action will swipe up slightly to ensure the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button is fully visible and accessible. This may resolve any issues with the button not responding to taps. After this, I will retry tapping the button. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen highlights the McRib promotion: \"McRib is back.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 1800}} | Description: This action will tap on the Spicy McCrispy sandwich image in the \"Deals\" section to view the details of the deal. This is the next step in determining if the deal can be added to the mobile order. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button, adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. This is the next step in fulfilling the user's request. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is identical to the screen before the action. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was not successfully tapped, and the deal was not added to the mobile order. The potential reason could be a missed or incorrect tap on the button.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button again, aiming to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is identical to the screen before the action. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was tapped, but the app did not proceed to the next step in the ordering process. The action did not produce the expected behavior, possibly due to a failure in registering the tap or an issue within the app.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1800, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 1600}} | Description: This action will swipe up slightly to ensure the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button is fully visible and accessible. This may resolve any issues with the button not responding to taps. After this, I will retry tapping the button. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If so, help me add that to Mobile Order (Do not pay yet, I will do it myself). And then check the pickup location and get directions on Google Maps. Stop at the screen showing the route.\n\n### Overall Plan ###\nThe current plan remains valid: 1. Open the McDonald's app. \u2705  2. Check for any rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. \u2705  3. If a deal exists, add the Spicy McCrispy to the mobile order without completing the payment. \u2705  4. Check the pickup location in the McDonald's app.  5. Open Google Maps and search for the pickup location.  6. Display the route to the pickup location on Google Maps.\n\n### Progress Status ###\nThe \"Use Deal\" button was successfully tapped, and the deal for the Spicy McCrispy has been added to the basket. The app now shows a confirmation message stating, \"This deal is already added to the basket,\" and provides the option to proceed with the mobile order. The next step is to check the pickup location and get directions on Google Maps. Stop at the screen showing the route.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nCheck the pickup location in the McDonald's app.\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone. Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen highlights the McRib promotion: \"McRib is back.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button, adding the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. This is the next step in fulfilling the user's request. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is identical to the screen before the action. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was not successfully tapped, and the deal was not added to the mobile order. The potential reason could be a missed or incorrect tap on the button.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button again, aiming to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is identical to the screen before the action. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was tapped, but the app did not proceed to the next step in the ordering process. The action did not produce the expected behavior, possibly due to a failure in registering the tap or an issue within the app.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1800, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 1600}} | Description: This action will swipe up slightly to ensure the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button is fully visible and accessible. This may resolve any issues with the button not responding to taps. After this, I will retry tapping the button. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 799, 'y': 2119}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Use Deal\" button to confirm the deal and add the Spicy McCrispy sandwich to the mobile order. The app should proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen highlights the McRib promotion: \"McRib is back.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button again, aiming to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The screen after the action is identical to the screen before the action. This indicates that the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button was tapped, but the app did not proceed to the next step in the ordering process. The action did not produce the expected behavior, possibly due to a failure in registering the tap or an issue within the app.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1800, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 1600}} | Description: This action will swipe up slightly to ensure the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button is fully visible and accessible. This may resolve any issues with the button not responding to taps. After this, I will retry tapping the button. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 799, 'y': 2119}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Use Deal\" button to confirm the deal and add the Spicy McCrispy sandwich to the mobile order. The app should proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 67, 'y': 144}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon at the top-left corner of the screen to close the current deal confirmation screen. This should return to the main app interface, where the pickup location can be verified. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note: Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones: - The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen highlights the McRib promotion: \"McRib is back.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1800, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 1600}} | Description: This action will swipe up slightly to ensure the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button is fully visible and accessible. This may resolve any issues with the button not responding to taps. After this, I will retry tapping the button. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 799, 'y': 2119}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Use Deal\" button to confirm the deal and add the Spicy McCrispy sandwich to the mobile order. The app should proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 67, 'y': 144}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon at the top-left corner of the screen to close the current deal confirmation screen. This should return to the main app interface, where the pickup location can be verified. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to navigate to Google Maps to search for the pickup location and display the route. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen highlights the McRib promotion: \"McRib is back.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 2000}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Add to Mobile Order\" button to add the Spicy McCrispy deal to the mobile order. If successful, the app should proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 799, 'y': 2119}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Use Deal\" button to confirm the deal and add the Spicy McCrispy sandwich to the mobile order. The app should proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 67, 'y': 144}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon at the top-left corner of the screen to close the current deal confirmation screen. This should return to the main app interface, where the pickup location can be verified. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to navigate to Google Maps to search for the pickup location and display the route. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 663, 'y': 2076}} | Description: This action will tap on the Google Maps app icon visible in the app switcher. This will open Google Maps, allowing me to search for the pickup location and display the route. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 799, 'y': 2119}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Use Deal\" button to confirm the deal and add the Spicy McCrispy sandwich to the mobile order. The app should proceed to the next step in the ordering process. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 67, 'y': 144}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon at the top-left corner of the screen to close the current deal confirmation screen. This should return to the main app interface, where the pickup location can be verified. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to navigate to Google Maps to search for the pickup location and display the route. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 663, 'y': 2076}} | Description: This action will tap on the Google Maps app icon visible in the app switcher. This will open Google Maps, allowing me to search for the pickup location and display the route. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 169}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar labeled \"Search here\" to activate it, allowing me to type the address \"616 E Green St\" for the search. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen highlights the McRib promotion: \"McRib is back.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 67, 'y': 144}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon at the top-left corner of the screen to close the current deal confirmation screen. This should return to the main app interface, where the pickup location can be verified. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to navigate to Google Maps to search for the pickup location and display the route. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 663, 'y': 2076}} | Description: This action will tap on the Google Maps app icon visible in the app switcher. This will open Google Maps, allowing me to search for the pickup location and display the route. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 169}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar labeled \"Search here\" to activate it, allowing me to type the address \"616 E Green St\" for the search. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Type', 'arguments': {'text': '616 E Green St'}} | Description: This action will type the address \"616 E Green St\" into the search bar in Google Maps. Once the address is entered, I will proceed to display the route. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The McDonald's app is open.  - The current screen highlights the McRib promotion: \"McRib is back.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (red pencil icon) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Switch_App', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will open the app switcher, allowing me to navigate to Google Maps to search for the pickup location and display the route. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 663, 'y': 2076}} | Description: This action will tap on the Google Maps app icon visible in the app switcher. This will open Google Maps, allowing me to search for the pickup location and display the route. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 169}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar labeled \"Search here\" to activate it, allowing me to type the address \"616 E Green St\" for the search. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Type', 'arguments': {'text': '616 E Green St'}} | Description: This action will type the address \"616 E Green St\" into the search bar in Google Maps. Once the address is entered, I will proceed to display the route. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 453, 'y': 309}} | Description: This action will tap on the search result for \"616 East Green Street, Champaign, IL,\" which is located at the top of the list. This will display the route to the selected location. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Summarize the general sentiment in the Notes.\n\n---\nCarefully reflect on the interaction history of the current task. Check if there are any subgoals that are accomplished by a sequence of successful actions and can be consolidated into new \"Shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions. For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.  5. If a search action fails, verify the input text and ensure the correct search bar is targeted before retrying. Adjust the tap location if necessary.  6. When recording information from search results, ensure the details are accurate and clearly formatted to avoid confusion.  7. If a task involves multiple steps across different apps, always confirm the completion of one step before proceeding to the next to avoid errors or omissions.  8. If a search query fails to execute, double-check the tap location and ensure the search bar is properly activated before typing. Retry the action with slight adjustments if necessary.  9. When selecting a video or item from a list, ensure the title matches the intended choice to avoid selecting the wrong option.\n\n### Full Action History ###\n- Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 915, 'y': 1084}} | Description: This action will tap on the McDonald's app icon to open it, allowing us to check for rewards or deals related to the Spicy McCrispy sandwich. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The McDonald's app has been successfully opened.
