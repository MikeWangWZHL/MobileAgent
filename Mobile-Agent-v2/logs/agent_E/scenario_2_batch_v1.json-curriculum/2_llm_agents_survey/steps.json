If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here. Otherwise, keep the current plan and copy it here.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nThe next subgoal to work on. If the previous subgoal is not yet complete, copy it here. If all subgoals are completed, write \"Finished\".\n",

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[97, 42]; text: 4:26\n[737, 158]; text: \u5341\n[179, 158]; text: 00\n[877, 158]; text: 0\n[417, 159]; text: 5 google.com/m?client\n[1009, 163]; text: :\n[866, 306]; text: ...\n...\n[1000, 306]; text: M\n[174, 304]; text: ALL\n[334, 303]; text: IMAGES\n[548, 629]; text: Google\n[859, 703]; text: \u8bfb\n[301, 1114]; text: Intro to speculative\n[353, 1187]; text: decoding: Cheat codes\n[244, 1259]; text: for faster LLMs\n[1004, 1354]; text: 8\n[240, 1364]; text: The Register \u00b7 3h\n[499, 2109]; text: There may have been a second big\n[418, 2181]; text: bang - and it could solve the\n[241, 2269]; text: III\n[849, 2269]; text: <\n[881, 1177]; icon: The app logo has three rounded rectangles stacked vertically with two horizontal lines at top and bottom on white background.\n[964, 911]; icon: The icon is round with a multicolored camera design inside it, primarily featuring red, yellow, blue, and green colors.\n[999, 303]; icon: The icon is round, grayish-blue with white letter \"M\".\n[67, 304]; icon: This is an icon.\n[829, 909]; icon: The Google Assistant app logo on my home screen has a white circle with blue text that says \"Google\" inside it, all set against a red background.\n[68, 158]; icon: This is an icon.\n[876, 157]; icon: The icon is square-shaped with rounded corners, filled with white color, and has black borderlines.\n[865, 304]; icon: The icon is a white circle with black dots arranged in a grid-like pattern, representing a speaker or audio symbol commonly used on smartphone interfaces.\n[860, 698]; icon: The icon is shaped like a gear and has a greenish hue to it.\n[956, 1230]; icon: This is an icon.\n[757, 1236]; icon: The icon is round with two blue tabs on top, resembling a toilet seat lid.\n[503, 556]; icon: This is an icon.\n[614, 546]; icon: The icon is shaped like a rounded rectangle and has a red background with white text that reads \"i\".\n[72, 1364]; icon: The icon has a circle shape with two overlapping white half-circles inside, giving it a \"\u221e\" appearance, all on a red background.\n[539, 912]; icon: This is an icon.\n[400, 157]; icon: This is an icon.\n[542, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black border, and has two overlapping gray half-circles inside it.\n[297, 715]; icon: The icon is circular with a yellow border, featuring two hands that appear to be holding something or giving high-five gesture at center.\n[735, 157]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, and its background is white while the border is black.\n[964, 41]; icon: The Wi-Fi symbol is rectangular with white outline, while the signal strength indicator has rounded corners and also appears as a white outlined rectangle on a black background.\n[656, 656]; icon: The letter \"g\" appears in blue with green and purple outlines, giving it a three-dimensional appearance.\n[961, 1103]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, and its background is gray while the text on it is white.\n[865, 1201]; icon: The icon has two rounded rectangles, with black buttons on top and red A/B buttons below them.\n[398, 695]; icon: The icon is shaped like a circle with a flower design inside, and it has pink petals surrounding green leaves.\n[112, 909]; icon: This is an icon.\n[246, 643]; icon: The icon is shaped like a rectangle with rounded corners, and its background color is blue.\n[341, 612]; icon: The letter G, colored blue with white outline, surrounded by multicolored squiggly lines.\n[514, 720]; icon: This is an icon.\n[715, 1762]; icon: This is an icon.\n[589, 741]; icon: This is an icon.\n[784, 638]; icon: This is an icon.\n[175, 302]; icon: This is an icon.\n[926, 41]; icon: The icon is black with white lines, shaped like two arrows angled to each other pointing up and down.\n[214, 42]; icon: The icon is a white line with two small black dots on either side, depicting a subtraction symbol.\n[169, 42]; icon: The icon is a heart with a white outline on a red background, filled with gray.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome browser, allowing me to perform a search for survey papers on LLM agents. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome browser, allowing me to perform a search for survey papers on LLM agents. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 630, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and execute the search, leading to relevant results on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"survey papers on LLM agents\" was supposed to be entered into the search bar, but the screen after the action shows no evidence of the search being executed. The content on the screen remains unrelated to the intended query, indicating that the action did not perform as expected.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n1. \"A Survey on Large Language Model based Autonomous Agents\" by L. Wang (2023).  2. \"Paitesanshi/LLM-Agent-Survey\" (GitHub repository with a comprehensive survey).  3. \"The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents\" (GitHub repository with a systematic survey).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome browser, allowing me to perform a search for survey papers on LLM agents. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 630, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and execute the search, leading to relevant results on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"survey papers on LLM agents\" was supposed to be entered into the search bar, but the screen after the action shows no evidence of the search being executed. The content on the screen remains unrelated to the intended query, indicating that the action did not perform as expected.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 160, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar at the top of the screen, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and execute the search. This should lead to relevant results on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n1. \"A Survey on Large Language Model based Autonomous Agents\" by L. Wang (2023).  2. \"Paitesanshi/LLM-Agent-Survey\" (GitHub repository with a comprehensive survey).  3. \"The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents\" (GitHub repository with a systematic survey).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome browser, allowing me to perform a search for survey papers on LLM agents. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 630, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and execute the search, leading to relevant results on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"survey papers on LLM agents\" was supposed to be entered into the search bar, but the screen after the action shows no evidence of the search being executed. The content on the screen remains unrelated to the intended query, indicating that the action did not perform as expected.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 160, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar at the top of the screen, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and execute the search. This should lead to relevant results on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing access to the Notes app to record the identified survey paper titles. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[101, 42]; text: 4:30\n[435, 456]; text: All r\n[601, 459]; text: notes\n[989, 822]; text: C\n[539, 1514]; text: No notes\n[537, 1606]; text: Tap the Add button to create a note.\n[544, 2269]; text: O\n[246, 2270]; text: III\n[855, 2271]; text: <\n[931, 2056]; icon: The app logo is a square with rounded corners, filled with orange-red color inside, and there's also a gray pen mark on it.\n[89, 815]; icon: The icon is round, black with white lines that look like three horizontal or stacked bars.\n[988, 816]; icon: The PDF document add/edit button has a white square with a green checkmark on it, outlined in black.\n[932, 2055]; icon: The icon is square-shaped with rounded corners, has a red background, and features a white pencil inside it.\n[542, 2268]; icon: This is an icon.\n[539, 455]; icon: This is an icon.\n[964, 42]; icon: The WiFi signal indicator displays as two horizontal lines with rounded ends, colored green to indicate optimal connection strength. The cellular data symbol appears as three vertical bars stacked on top of each other, also colored green for good reception quality.\n[215, 42]; icon: The icon is\u5706\u5f62 (round) and\u9ed1\u8272 (black).\n[927, 41]; icon: The WiFi symbol is a white rectangle with two curved lines, representing arrows pointing up and down, colored in black on a gray background.\n[847, 2268]; icon: The arrow icon on the phone screen has a white outline with a blue fill, pointing to the left.\n[241, 2269]; icon: This is an icon.\n[144, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[96, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[540, 1515]; icon: The icon is a square with rounded corners, filled with white or light gray color.\n[407, 453]; icon: The icon is a white \"All\" button with rounded rectangular shape on a black background.\n[169, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[994, 41]; icon: The icon on the phone screen has a white outline with black filling, depicting two vertical lines stacked atop each other to represent signal strength or battery life status.\n[1010, 41]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, white in color, and depicts a speakerphone symbol.\n[89, 816]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, filled with gray lines on a white background.\n[930, 2052]; icon: The icon is square-shaped with rounded corners, featuring a bold orange hue against a contrasting black background.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n1. \"A Survey on Large Language Model based Autonomous Agents\" by L. Wang (2023).  2. \"Paitesanshi/LLM-Agent-Survey\" (GitHub repository with a comprehensive survey).  3. \"The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents\" (GitHub repository with a systematic survey).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome browser, allowing me to perform a search for survey papers on LLM agents. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 630, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and execute the search, leading to relevant results on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"survey papers on LLM agents\" was supposed to be entered into the search bar, but the screen after the action shows no evidence of the search being executed. The content on the screen remains unrelated to the intended query, indicating that the action did not perform as expected.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 160, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar at the top of the screen, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and execute the search. This should lead to relevant results on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing access to the Notes app to record the identified survey paper titles. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note and add the identified survey paper titles. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[101, 43]; text: 4:31\n[888, 158]; text: \u5341\n[769, 157]; text: \u4e2d\n[218, 161]; text: Title\n[1009, 1880]; text: 1/1\n[480, 2094]; text: I\n[612, 2085]; text: \u56db\n[537, 2180]; text: ADB Keyboard {ON}\n[243, 2269]; text: III\n[542, 2270]; text: \u25cb\n[216, 2090]; icon: This is an icon.\n[612, 2088]; icon: This is an icon.\n[480, 2092]; icon: The icon is a white capital letter \"T\" with a black outline, depicting text selection on a phone screen.\n[766, 157]; icon: The icon is a white book with black lines outlining its pages, set against a blue background.\n[72, 2089]; icon: This is an icon.\n[347, 2090]; icon: The icon is shaped like a square with rounded corners, and it has a white background with black text that says \"T\".\n[73, 2088]; icon: The icon is shaped like a house with a person inside, colored in shades of blue and green.\n[886, 157]; icon: This is an icon.\n[542, 2268]; icon: This is an icon.\n[56, 2271]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, has a white background, black text that says \"Back\" within two curved lines forming a speech bubble pointing to the left, and a gray arrowhead pointing to the right inside the speech bubble.\n[963, 42]; icon: The Wi-Fi symbol is a circle with three horizontal lines inside, while the signal strength indicator is a vertical line that's thicker at the bottom than the top. Both symbols have white outlines on a transparent background.\n[1006, 2090]; icon: The icon is black with white curved arrow pointing to the right.\n[876, 2089]; icon: The icon is shaped like an arrow pointing to the left, with a curved line at the end, and it's colored white on a blue background.\n[218, 159]; icon: This is an icon.\n[845, 2266]; icon: The icon is shaped like a white arrowhead pointing downwards on a black background, with a red circle surrounding it.\n[89, 157]; icon: The icon is shaped like an arrow pointing to the left, with a blue background and white outline.\n[209, 42]; icon: The icon is a white horizontal line with two small dots on either end, all within a blue circle.\n[91, 42]; icon: The time icon on the phone screen has a white background with black numbers, indicating that it's currently 4:31.\n[880, 105]; icon: The icon has two horizontal lines at its top, with three vertical dots stacked vertically on the right side. The background is black while the text is white.\n[926, 41]; icon: The icon is a white circle with two black lines forming an \"X\" shape, representing Wi-Fi disconnection or no signal strength.\n[241, 2268]; icon: The icon has three vertical lines, each with two horizontal dashes below them, all within a blue circle.\n[988, 156]; icon: The icon is circular, contains three black dots, and has a white background.\n[166, 104]; icon: The heart icon is circular with white outline, filled with red color.\n[868, 156]; icon: The icon is shaped like a vertical rectangle with rounded corners, has a white background, and displays two horizontal lines stacked on top of each other to represent adding something or creating new content.\n[1005, 1878]; icon: This is an icon.\n[163, 42]; icon: The icon is a white heart on a red circle background.\n[729, 2090]; icon: The number '17' is displayed in white against a black background, enclosed in a rounded rectangular blue border with gray stripes.\n[993, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[141, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[1009, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[538, 2098]; icon: The icon is round, filled with grayish-blue color and has white outline.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has been activated and you can type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When identifying the most-cited paper or similar tasks, ensure to sort the results by citation count if the option is available. This minimizes manual scanning and reduces errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n1. \"A Survey on Large Language Model based Autonomous Agents\" by L. Wang (2023).  2. \"Paitesanshi/LLM-Agent-Survey\" (GitHub repository with a comprehensive survey).  3. \"The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents\" (GitHub repository with a systematic survey).\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 630, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and execute the search, leading to relevant results on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"survey papers on LLM agents\" was supposed to be entered into the search bar, but the screen after the action shows no evidence of the search being executed. The content on the screen remains unrelated to the intended query, indicating that the action did not perform as expected.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 160, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar at the top of the screen, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and execute the search. This should lead to relevant results on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing access to the Notes app to record the identified survey paper titles. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note and add the identified survey paper titles. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 930, 'y': 2055}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button (red pencil icon) to create a new note in the Notes app, enabling me to input the survey paper titles. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Open the Google app or Chrome browser. 2. Search for \"survey papers on LLM agents\" on Google Scholar. 3. Identify at least three relevant survey papers and note their titles. 4. Open the Notes app and add the titles to a new note.\n\n### Progress Status ###\nThe titles of the three survey papers have been successfully added to the note. The task is complete.\n\n### Atomic Actions ###\nHere are the atomic actions in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n### Existing Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nHere are some existing shortcuts you have created:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Full Action History ###\n- Action: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome browser, allowing me to perform a search for survey papers on LLM agents. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The Chrome browser has been successfully opened. Progress updated to: \"Chrome browser is open, ready to perform a search for survey papers on LLM agents.\"\n- Action: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 630, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and execute the search, leading to relevant results on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"survey papers on LLM agents\" was supposed to be entered into the search bar, but the screen after the action shows no evidence of the search being executed. The content on the screen remains unrelated to the intended query, indicating that the action did not perform as expected.\n- Action: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 160, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar at the top of the screen, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and execute the search. This should lead to relevant results on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The search for \"survey papers on LLM agents\" on Google Scholar has been successfully executed. The results include relevant survey papers, such as: 1. \"A Survey on Large Language Model based Autonomous Agents\" by L. Wang (2023). 2. \"Paitesanshi/LLM-Agent-Survey\" (GitHub repository with a comprehensive survey). 3. \"The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents\" (GitHub repository with a systematic survey).\n- Action: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing access to the Notes app to record the identified survey paper titles. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The home screen has been successfully accessed, allowing the user to open the Notes app to record the identified survey paper titles.\n- Action: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app, allowing me to create a new note and add the identified survey paper titles. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The Notes app has been successfully opened, allowing the user to create a new note and add the identified survey paper titles.\n- Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 930, 'y': 2055}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Add\" button (red pencil icon) to create a new note in the Notes app, enabling me to input the survey paper titles. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The Notes app has been successfully opened, and a new note has been created. The user can now input the survey paper titles.\n- Action: {'name': 'Type', 'arguments': {'text': '1. \"A Survey on Large Language Model based Autonomous Agents\" by L. Wang (2023)\\n2. \"Paitesanshi/LLM-Agent-Survey\" (GitHub repository with a comprehensive survey)\\n3. \"The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents\" (GitHub repository with a systematic survey)'}} | Description: This action will type the titles of the three survey papers into the note, as requested. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The titles of the three survey papers have been successfully added to the note. The task is complete.\n\n---\n### Future Tasks ###\nHere are some tasks that you might be asked to do in the future:\n- I have some onions, beef, and potatoes in my refrigerator. Can you find me a Chinese-style recipe that uses all three ingredients and can be prepared in under an hour? And find me a video tutorial on YouTube for that. Stop at the screen displaying the video.\n- Can you check the MacDonald's APP to see if there are any Rewards or Deals including Spicy McCrispy. If so, help me add that to Mobile Order (Do not pay yet, I will do it myself). And then check the pickup location and get directions on Google Maps. Stop at the screen showing the route.\n- Find three detailed user reviews of the Bose QC45 headphones from Amazon. Summarize the general sentiment in the Notes.\n\n---\nCarefully reflect on the interaction history of the current task. Check if there are any subgoals that are accomplished by a sequence of successful actions and can be consolidated into new \"Shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions. For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",
