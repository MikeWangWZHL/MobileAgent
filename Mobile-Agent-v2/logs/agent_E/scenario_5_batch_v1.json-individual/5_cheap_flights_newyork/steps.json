If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The Booking.com app has been successfully opened. - The \"Flights\" section is accessible from the top navigation bar.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 914, 'y': 1621}} | Description: I will tap on the Booking.com app icon to open the app and proceed with the task of finding the cheapest round-trip flight. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 914, 'y': 1621}} | Description: I will tap on the Booking.com app icon to open the app and proceed with the task of finding the cheapest round-trip flight. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 516, 'y': 328}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Flights\" option in the top navigation bar to navigate to the section where I can search for flights. This will allow me to proceed with entering the travel details for the user's request. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[94, 43]; text: 2:22\n[966, 159]; text: Cancel\n[198, 293]; text: Where to?\n[242, 453]; text: Enter airport or city\n[491, 560]; text: Select multiple airports at once and compare flights\n[228, 684]; text: Your recent searches\n[329, 817]; text: New York \u00b7 All airports\nNew York, United States\n[538, 2178]; text: ADB Keyboard {ON}\n[245, 2270]; text: III\n[542, 2270]; text: O\n[543, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black border, and has two small dots inside representing app launchers on a smartphone home screen.\n[55, 2271]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, has a white background, black text that says \"Search\", and a magnifying glass symbol to the right of the word \"Search\".\n[845, 2266]; icon: The icon is shaped like a white arrowhead pointing downwards on a black background, with a red circle surrounding it.\n[967, 158]; icon: This is an icon.\n[926, 40]; icon: The icon is a whiteWiFi symbol with a black outline, depicting two arrows pointing up and down to indicate network connectivity or signal strength.\n[78, 789]; icon: The location pin on a smartphone map application, typically depicted as a red or green marker with a white outline, indicating the user's current position or selected destination.\n[197, 294]; icon: This is an icon.\n[214, 41]; icon: The icon is a white heart on a blue background with rounded corners, typical of mobile app icons.\n[143, 42]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black border, featuring two intersecting lines forming a \"minus\" symbol (-) at the center.\n[241, 2268]; icon: This is an icon.\n[95, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[166, 42]; icon: The icon is a white horizontal line with two black dots on either end, representing a minus symbol or subtraction sign.\n[303, 295]; icon: This is an icon.\n[965, 42]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, filled with white lines indicating Wi-Fi signals on the left side and battery life on the right side, all set against a black background.\n[992, 42]; icon: The icon is a white signal bar with three horizontal lines, representing good cellular reception on a smartphone or mobile device.\n[1010, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has been activated and you can type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The Booking.com app has been successfully opened.  - The \"Flights\" section is accessible from the top navigation bar.  - The current screen allows the user to input travel details:   - Trip type: Round-trip, One-way, or Multi-city.   - Origin: Chicago (defaulted to \"Chicago \u00b7 All airports\").   - Destination: To be entered.   - Dates: Defaulted to \"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\".   - Passengers and class: Defaulted to \"1 adult, Economy\".   - Option to filter for \"Direct flights only\".  - A \"Search\" button is available to proceed with the flight search.  - The \"Where to?\" field has been successfully activated, and the keyboard is ready for input.  - The \"Your recent searches\" section includes \"New York \u00b7 All airports, New York, United States,\" which can be selected as the destination.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 914, 'y': 1621}} | Description: I will tap on the Booking.com app icon to open the app and proceed with the task of finding the cheapest round-trip flight. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 516, 'y': 328}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Flights\" option in the top navigation bar to navigate to the section where I can search for flights. This will allow me to proceed with entering the travel details for the user's request. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 276, 'y': 976}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Where to?\" field to activate the keyboard and prepare to input \"New York City\" as the destination. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 914, 'y': 1621}} | Description: I will tap on the Booking.com app icon to open the app and proceed with the task of finding the cheapest round-trip flight. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 516, 'y': 328}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Flights\" option in the top navigation bar to navigate to the section where I can search for flights. This will allow me to proceed with entering the travel details for the user's request. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 276, 'y': 976}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Where to?\" field to activate the keyboard and prepare to input \"New York City\" as the destination. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 329, 'y': 817}} | Description: I will tap on the \"New York \u00b7 All airports\" option in the \"Your recent searches\" section to select it as the destination. This will update the destination field and allow me to proceed with entering the travel details. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The Booking.com app has been successfully opened.  - The \"Flights\" section is accessible from the top navigation bar.  - The current screen allows the user to input travel details:   - Trip type: Round-trip, One-way, or Multi-city.   - Origin: Chicago (defaulted to \"Chicago \u00b7 All airports\").   - Destination: New York \u00b7 All airports (successfully selected).   - Dates: Defaulted to \"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\".   - Passengers and class: Defaulted to \"1 adult, Economy\".   - Option to filter for \"Direct flights only\".  - A \"Search\" button is available to proceed with the flight search.  - The \"Where to?\" field has been successfully activated, and the keyboard is ready for input.  - The \"Your recent searches\" section includes \"New York \u00b7 All airports, New York, United States,\" which has been selected as the destination.  - The travel dates are currently set to \"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\" and can be adjusted using the calendar interface.  - The \"Done\" button is available to confirm the selected dates.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 516, 'y': 328}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Flights\" option in the top navigation bar to navigate to the section where I can search for flights.

This will allow me to select travel dates within the next month. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 276, 'y': 976}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Where to?\" field to activate the keyboard and prepare to input \"New York City\" as the destination. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 329, 'y': 817}} | Description: I will tap on the \"New York \u00b7 All airports\" option in the \"Your recent searches\" section to select it as the destination. This will update the destination field and allow me to proceed with entering the travel details. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 402, 'y': 1134}} | Description: I will tap on the date field (\"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\") to open the date selection interface, allowing me to adjust the travel dates to any within the next month. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This will allow me to select travel dates within the next month. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe downward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action will move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The Booking.com app has been successfully opened.  - The \"Flights\" section is accessible from the top navigation bar.  - The current screen allows the user to input travel details:   - Trip type: Round-trip, One-way, or Multi-city.   - Origin: Chicago (defaulted to \"Chicago \u00b7 All airports\").   - Destination: New York \u00b7 All airports (successfully selected).   - Dates: Defaulted to \"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\".   - Passengers and class: Defaulted to \"1 adult, Economy\".   - Option to filter for \"Direct flights only\".  - A \"Search\" button is available to proceed with the flight search.  - The \"Where to?\" field has been successfully activated, and the keyboard is ready for input.  - The \"Your recent searches\" section includes \"New York \u00b7 All airports, New York, United States,\" which has been selected as the destination.  - The travel dates are currently set to \"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\" and can be adjusted using the calendar interface.  - The \"Done\" button is available to confirm the selected dates.  - The calendar is currently displaying **July 2025** instead of November 2023. The user needs to swipe back to navigate to November 2023.  - The \"Cancel\" button is available to exit the calendar interface.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 329, 'y': 817}} | Description: I will tap on the \"New York \u00b7 All airports\" option in the \"Your recent searches\" section to select it as the destination. This will update the destination field and allow me to proceed with entering the travel details. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 402, 'y': 1134}} | Description: I will tap on the date field (\"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\") to open the date selection interface, allowing me to adjust the travel dates to any within the next month. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This will allow me to select travel dates within the next month. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe downward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action will move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe downward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action will move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The Booking.com app has been successfully opened.  - The \"Flights\" section is accessible from the top navigation bar.  - The current screen allows the user to input travel details:   - Trip type: Round-trip, One-way, or Multi-city.   - Origin: Chicago (defaulted to \"Chicago \u00b7 All airports\").   - Destination: New York \u00b7 All airports (successfully selected).   - Dates: Defaulted to \"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\".   - Passengers and class: Defaulted to \"1 adult, Economy\".   - Option to filter for \"Direct flights only\".  - A \"Search\" button is available to proceed with the flight search.  - The \"Where to?\" field has been successfully activated, and the keyboard is ready for input.  - The \"Your recent searches\" section includes \"New York \u00b7 All airports, New York, United States,\" which has been selected as the destination.  - The travel dates are currently set to \"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\" and can be adjusted using the calendar interface.  - The \"Done\" button is available to confirm the selected dates.  - The calendar is currently displaying **August 2025** instead of November 2023. The user needs to swipe back to navigate to November 2023.  - The \"Cancel\" button is available to exit the calendar interface.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 402, 'y': 1134}} | Description: I will tap on the date field (\"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\") to open the date selection interface, allowing me to adjust the travel dates to any within the next month. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This will allow me to select travel dates within the next month. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe downward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action will move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe downward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action will move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe upward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action will move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The Booking.com app has been successfully opened.  - The \"Flights\" section is accessible from the top navigation bar.  - The current screen allows the user to input travel details:   - Trip type: Round-trip, One-way, or Multi-city.   - Origin: Chicago (defaulted to \"Chicago \u00b7 All airports\").   - Destination: New York \u00b7 All airports (successfully selected).   - Dates: Defaulted to \"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\".   - Passengers and class: Defaulted to \"1 adult, Economy\".   - Option to filter for \"Direct flights only\".  - A \"Search\" button is available to proceed with the flight search.  - The \"Where to?\" field has been successfully activated, and the keyboard is ready for input.  - The \"Your recent searches\" section includes \"New York \u00b7 All airports, New York, United States,\" which has been selected as the destination.  - The travel dates are currently set to \"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\" and can be adjusted using the calendar interface.  - The \"Done\" button is available to confirm the selected dates.  - The calendar is currently displaying **October 2025** instead of November 2023. The user needs to swipe back to navigate to November 2023.  - The \"Cancel\" button is available to exit the calendar interface.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This will allow me to select travel dates within the next month. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe downward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The Booking.com app has been successfully opened.  - The \"Flights\" section is accessible from the top navigation bar.  - The current screen allows the user to input travel details:   - Trip type: Round-trip, One-way, or Multi-city.   - Origin: Chicago (defaulted to \"Chicago \u00b7 All airports\").   - Destination: New York \u00b7 All airports (successfully selected).   - Dates: Defaulted to \"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\".   - Passengers and class: Defaulted to \"1 adult, Economy\".   - Option to filter for \"Direct flights only\".  - A \"Search\" button is available to proceed with the flight search.  - The \"Where to?\" field has been successfully activated, and the keyboard is ready for input.  - The \"Your recent searches\" section includes \"New York \u00b7 All airports, New York, United States,\" which has been selected as the destination.  - The travel dates are currently set to \"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\" and can be adjusted using the calendar interface.  - The \"Done\" button is available to confirm the selected dates.  - The calendar is currently displaying **December 2025** instead of November 2023. The user needs to swipe back to navigate to November 2023.  - The \"Cancel\" button is available to exit the calendar interface.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe downward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[96, 43]; text: 2:30\n[966, 159]; text: Cancel\n[148, 295]; text: When?\n[669, 410]; text: Thu\n[938, 411]; text: Sat\n[806, 413]; text: fri\n[403, 412]; text: tue\n[537, 412]; text: Wed\n[268, 413]; text: Mon\n[134, 413]; text: Sun\n[808, 511]; text: 14\n[404, 512]; text: 11\n[270, 512]; text: 10\n[541, 514]; text: 12\n[672, 512]; text: 13\n[945, 512]; text: 15\n[133, 513]; text: 9\n[270, 645]; text: 17\n[538, 645]; text: 19\n[673, 647]; text: 20\n[806, 648]; text: 21\n[943, 647]; text: 22\n[133, 645]; text: 16\n[406, 647]; text: 18\n[270, 780]; text: 24\n[539, 781]; text: 26\n[673, 781]; text: 27\n[132, 781]; text: 23\n[402, 779]; text: 25\n[808, 781]; text: 28\n[940, 779]; text: 29\n[133, 916]; text: 30\n[249, 1091]; text: December 2025\n[809, 1187]; text: 5\n[267, 1187]; text: 1\n[404, 1189]; text: 2\n[539, 1189]; text: 3\n[674, 1189]; text: 4\n[942, 1188]; text: 6\n[673, 1324]; text: 11\n[133, 1323]; text: 7\n[811, 1323]; text: 12\n[540, 1324]; text: 10\n[943, 1324]; text: 13\n[271, 1323]; text: 8\n[404, 1323]; text: 9\n[134, 1456]; text: 14\n[539, 1455]; text: 17\n[674, 1457]; text: 18\n[808, 1455]; text: 19\n[942, 1457]; text: 20\n[269, 1456]; text: 15\n[403, 1457]; text: 16\n[673, 1590]; text: 25\n[943, 1590]; text: 27\n[131, 1591]; text: 21\n[269, 1591]; text: 22\n[403, 1591]; text: 23\n[539, 1590]; text: 24\n[808, 1591]; text: 26\n[536, 1725]; text: 31\n[268, 1724]; text: 29\n[403, 1725]; text: 30\n[132, 1723]; text: 28\n[596, 1928]; text: \u83cc\n[91, 1929]; text: \u83cc\n[738, 1930]; text: Sat, Jan 18\n[229, 1932]; text: Sat, Jan 11\n[538, 2095]; text: Done\n[595, 1929]; icon: The icon is square-shaped with rounded corners, filled with blue-gray shades to represent a calendar or schedule function.\n[286, 1929]; icon: The calendar icon has a square shape with rounded corners, filled with blue-gray lines on white background.\n[89, 1929]; icon: The icon is square-shaped with rounded corners, filled with blueish-purple shades and has white text inside it that reads \"Calendar\".\n[543, 2268]; icon: The icon is round, white with a gray outline, and depicts two overlapping circles with a line connecting them to represent \"Settings\".\n[147, 294]; icon: The icon is a white question mark on a black background, enclosed in a rounded rectangular outline with a transparent background.\n[792, 1928]; icon: The calendar icon is rectangular with rounded corners, white text on gray background.\n[967, 158]; icon: The \"Cancel\" button on the phone screen has a white outline with gray fill, displayed against a blue background.\n[927, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[964, 41]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, filled with white text on a blue background indicating Wi-Fi connectivity and cellular data usage.\n[214, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[168, 42]; icon: The icon is a white circle with a horizontal black line through it, indicating a \"close\" or \"cancel\" action.\n[143, 41]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black border, featuring two intersecting lines forming an \"X\" at the intersection, representing the concept of closing or deleting something.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The Booking.com app has been successfully opened.  - The \"Flights\" section is accessible from the top navigation bar.  - The current screen allows the user to input travel details:   - Trip type: Round-trip, One-way, or Multi-city.   - Origin: Chicago (defaulted to \"Chicago \u00b7 All airports\").   - Destination: New York \u00b7 All airports (successfully selected).   - Dates: Defaulted to \"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\".   - Passengers and class: Defaulted to \"1 adult, Economy\".   - Option to filter for \"Direct flights only\".  - A \"Search\" button is available to proceed with the flight search.  - The \"Where to?\" field has been successfully activated, and the keyboard is ready for input.  - The \"Your recent searches\" section includes \"New York \u00b7 All airports, New York, United States,\" which has been selected as the destination.  - The travel dates are currently set to \"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\" and can be adjusted using the calendar interface.  - The \"Done\" button is available to confirm the selected dates.  - The calendar is currently displaying **December 2025** instead of November 2023. The user needs to swipe back to navigate to November 2023.  - The \"Cancel\" button is available to exit the calendar interface.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe downward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action will move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe upward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action will move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe downward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action will move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe upward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action will move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe downward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action will move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The calendar display remains on December 2025 after the swipe action. The expected behavior was for the calendar to move to an earlier month, but no change occurred. This could be due to an insufficient swipe distance or a misinterpretation of the swipe gesture by the application.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The Booking.com app has been successfully opened.  - The \"Flights\" section is accessible from the top navigation bar.  - The current screen allows the user to input travel details:   - Trip type: Round-trip, One-way, or Multi-city.   - Origin: Chicago (defaulted to \"Chicago \u00b7 All airports\").   - Destination: New York \u00b7 All airports (successfully selected).   - Dates: Defaulted to \"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\".   - Passengers and class: Defaulted to \"1 adult, Economy\".   - Option to filter for \"Direct flights only\".  - A \"Search\" button is available to proceed with the flight search.  - The \"Where to?\" field has been successfully activated, and the keyboard is ready for input.  - The \"Your recent searches\" section includes \"New York \u00b7 All airports, New York, United States,\" which has been selected as the destination.  - The travel dates are currently set to \"Sat, Jan 11 - Sat, Jan 18\" and can be adjusted using the calendar interface.  - The \"Done\" button is available to confirm the selected dates.  - The calendar is currently displaying **December 2025** instead of November 2023. The user needs to swipe back to navigate to November 2023.  - The \"Cancel\" button is available to exit the calendar interface.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe upward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action will move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe downward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action will move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe upward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action will move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe downward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action will move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The calendar display remains on December 2025 after the swipe action. The expected behavior was for the calendar to move to an earlier month, but no change occurred. This could be due to an insufficient swipe distance or a misinterpretation of the swipe gesture by the application.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1800, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 300}} | Description: I will perform a longer swipe upward on the calendar to navigate to earlier months, aiming to reach November 2023. This action should move the calendar display closer to the desired date range. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The calendar display remains on December 2025 after the swipe action, indicating that the swipe did not successfully navigate to an earlier month. This could be due to the swipe gesture not being recognized or not being long enough to trigger a change in the calendar view.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).\nNote that these information might not be entirely accurate.
