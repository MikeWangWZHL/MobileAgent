If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone of $102,500. - A user named \"Mr. Crypto Whale\" is hosting a giveaway of 1 Bitcoin (~$102,500) to one person. To participate, users need to like, retweet, and comment \"done\" on the post. The winner will be chosen randomly in 15 hours.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 414, 'y': 1740}} | Description: I will tap on the \"X\" app icon to open the app and proceed to check the trending section. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone of $102,500. - A user named \"Mr. Crypto Whale\" is hosting a giveaway of 1 Bitcoin (~$102,500) to one person.

If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 414, 'y': 1740}} | Description: I will tap on the \"X\" app icon to open the app and proceed to check the trending section. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 90, 'y': 2119}} | Description: I will tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the bottom left of the screen to navigate to the trending section and identify the top 3 trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping the search icon (magnifying glass) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The content displayed before and after the action remains the same, indicating that the app did not navigate to the trending section as expected.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[98, 42]; text: 7:01\n[985, 198]; text: 102,413.87\n[595, 274]; text: BINANC\n[987, 406]; text: 102,314.15\n[985, 613]; text: 102,214.42\n[233, 680]; text: Q1.3K\n[600, 680]; text: Q1.6K\n[414, 682]; text: 1\u95e871.2K\n[924, 684]; text: \u8d1d\n[783, 683]; text: \u5c71i153K\n[231, 782]; text: Temu\n[944, 785]; text: Ad\n[464, 784]; text: @shoptemu\n[90, 819]; text: 1610\nTEMU\n[558, 839]; text: Shop your favorite items on Temu at low\n[436, 897]; text: prices with great discounts.\n[616, 1083]; text: Christmas\n[605, 1228]; text: Sale!\n[618, 1480]; text: 90\n[892, 1446]; text: %\n[337, 1488]; text: UP\nTO\n[891, 1570]; text: OFF\n[611, 1683]; text: SHOP ON TEMU\n[304, 1865]; text: temu.com\n[474, 1920]; text: Unbeatable Prices on Temu\n[587, 2021]; text: 27\n[926, 2021]; text: W\n[1003, 2020]; text: d\n[380, 2020]; text: \u95e8\n[785, 2020]; text: ili431K\n[617, 2118]; text: x@elonmusk\u00b72h\n[281, 2119]; text: Elon Musk\n[258, 2271]; text: III\n[855, 2270]; text: <\n[89, 2152]; icon: The rocket ship has three stages, with each stage getting progressively smaller as they go up.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone of $102,500.  - A user named \"Mr. Crypto Whale\" is hosting a giveaway of 1 Bitcoin (~$102,500) to one person. To participate, users need to like, retweet, and comment \"done\" on the post. The winner will be chosen randomly in 15 hours.  - Temu is promoting a Christmas Sale with discounts of up to 90% off on their platform.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 414, 'y': 1740}} | Description: I will tap on the \"X\" app icon to open the app and proceed to check the trending section. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 90, 'y': 2119}} | Description: I will tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the bottom left of the screen to navigate to the trending section and identify the top 3 trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping the search icon (magnifying glass) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The content displayed before and after the action remains the same, indicating that the app did not navigate to the trending section as expected.\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible. This action may reveal additional options or sections, including the trending topics. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone of $102,500.  - A user named \"Mr. Crypto Whale\" is hosting a giveaway of 1 Bitcoin (~$102,500) to one person.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 414, 'y': 1740}} | Description: I will tap on the \"X\" app icon to open the app and proceed to check the trending section. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 90, 'y': 2119}} | Description: I will tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the bottom left of the screen to navigate to the trending section and identify the top 3 trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping the search icon (magnifying glass) did not result in any visible change on the screen.

This action may reveal additional options or sections, including the trending topics. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone of $102,500.  - A user named \"Mr. Crypto Whale\" is hosting a giveaway of 1 Bitcoin (~$102,500) to one person.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 90, 'y': 2119}} | Description: I will tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the bottom left of the screen to navigate to the trending section and identify the top 3 trending topics. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping the search icon (magnifying glass) did not result in any visible change on the screen.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones: - Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone of $102,500.  - A user named \"Mr. Crypto Whale\" is hosting a giveaway of 1 Bitcoin (~$102,500) to one person. To participate, users need to like, retweet, and comment \"done\" on the post.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone of $102,500.  - A user named \"Mr. Crypto Whale\" is hosting a giveaway of 1 Bitcoin (~$102,500) to one person.

Further exploration may be needed.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

This action may reveal additional options or sections, including the trending topics. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone of $102,500.  - A user named \"Mr. Crypto Whale\" is hosting a giveaway of 1 Bitcoin (~$102,500) to one person.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone of $102,500.  - A user named \"Mr. Crypto Whale\" is hosting a giveaway of 1 Bitcoin (~$102,500) to one person.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone of $102,500.  - A user named \"Mr. Crypto Whale\" is hosting a giveaway of 1 Bitcoin (~$102,500) to one person.

Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone of $102,500.  - A user named \"Mr. Crypto Whale\" is hosting a giveaway of 1 Bitcoin (~$102,500) to one person.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone of $102,500.  - A user named \"Mr. Crypto Whale\" is hosting a giveaway of 1 Bitcoin (~$102,500) to one person.

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note: Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone of $102,500.  - A user named \"Mr. Crypto Whale\" is hosting a giveaway of 1 Bitcoin (~$102,500) to one person.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone of $102,500.  - A user named \"Mr. Crypto Whale\" is hosting a giveaway of 1 Bitcoin (~$102,500) to one person.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone of $102,500.  - A user named \"Mr. Crypto Whale\" is hosting a giveaway of 1 Bitcoin (~$102,500) to one person.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible. This action may reveal additional options or sections, including the trending topics. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: I will swipe up on the screen again to explore more content and check if the trending section becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",
