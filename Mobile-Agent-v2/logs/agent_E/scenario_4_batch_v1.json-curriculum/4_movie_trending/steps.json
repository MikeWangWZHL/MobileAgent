If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 663, 'y': 1622}} | Description: Tapping on the Fandango app icon to open it and proceed to check the top trending movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 663, 'y': 1622}} | Description: Tapping on the Fandango app icon to open it and proceed to check the top trending movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 910, 'y': 2089}} | Description: Tapping the \"SKIP\" button to bypass the splash screen and proceed to the main interface of the Fandango app. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Tapping the \"SKIP\" button did not lead to the main interface of the Fandango app. Instead, it navigated to the \"My Orders\" page, which is unrelated to the task of checking the top 5 trending movies currently in theaters. This indicates that the app may have redirected to a default page instead of the expected main interface.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note: Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The top trending movies currently in theaters are:  1. **Moana 2 (2024)**: PG, 1 hr 40 min, Opened Wed, Nov 27, 2024.  2. **Wicked (2024)**: PG, 2 hr 40 min, Opened Fri, Nov 22, 2024.  3. **Kraven the Hunter (2024)**: R, 2 hr 7 min, Opened Fri, Dec 13, 2024. - Ratings for these movies are not visible in the current screen. Further steps are required to compare their ratings.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 663, 'y': 1622}} | Description: Tapping on the Fandango app icon to open it and proceed to check the top trending movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 910, 'y': 2089}} | Description: Tapping the \"SKIP\" button to bypass the splash screen and proceed to the main interface of the Fandango app. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Tapping the \"SKIP\" button did not lead to the main interface of the Fandango app. Instead, it navigated to the \"My Orders\" page, which is unrelated to the task of checking the top 5 trending movies currently in theaters. This indicates that the app may have redirected to a default page instead of the expected main interface.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 322, 'y': 2175}} | Description: Tapping the \"Movies\" icon in the bottom navigation bar to navigate to the section showing the top trending movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The top trending movies currently in theaters are:   1. **Moana 2 (2024)**: PG, 1 hr 40 min, Opened Wed, Nov 27, 2024.    - Ratings: 62% (Tomatometer), 87% (Audience Score).   2. **Wicked (2024)**: PG, 2 hr 40 min, Opened Fri, Nov 22, 2024.   3. **Kraven the Hunter (2024)**: R, 2 hr 7 min, Opened Fri, Dec 13, 2024.  - Ratings for \"Wicked (2024)\" and \"Kraven the Hunter (2024)\" are not visible in the current screen. Further steps are required to compare their ratings.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 663, 'y': 1622}} | Description: Tapping on the Fandango app icon to open it and proceed to check the top trending movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 910, 'y': 2089}} | Description: Tapping the \"SKIP\" button to bypass the splash screen and proceed to the main interface of the Fandango app. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Tapping the \"SKIP\" button did not lead to the main interface of the Fandango app. Instead, it navigated to the \"My Orders\" page, which is unrelated to the task of checking the top 5 trending movies currently in theaters. This indicates that the app may have redirected to a default page instead of the expected main interface.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 322, 'y': 2175}} | Description: Tapping the \"Movies\" icon in the bottom navigation bar to navigate to the section showing the top trending movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 473, 'y': 832}} | Description: Tapping on \"Moana 2 (2024)\" to access its detailed page and check its rating. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The top trending movies currently in theaters are:   1. **Moana 2 (2024)**: PG, 1 hr 40 min, Opened Wed, Nov 27, 2024.    - Ratings: 62% (Tomatometer), 87% (Audience Score).   2. **Wicked (2024)**: PG, 2 hr 40 min, Opened Fri, Nov 22, 2024.   3. **Kraven the Hunter (2024)**: R, 2 hr 7 min, Opened Fri, Dec 13, 2024.  - Ratings for \"Wicked (2024)\" and \"Kraven the Hunter (2024)\" are not visible in the current screen. Further steps are required to compare their ratings.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 663, 'y': 1622}} | Description: Tapping on the Fandango app icon to open it and proceed to check the top trending movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 910, 'y': 2089}} | Description: Tapping the \"SKIP\" button to bypass the splash screen and proceed to the main interface of the Fandango app. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Tapping the \"SKIP\" button did not lead to the main interface of the Fandango app. Instead, it navigated to the \"My Orders\" page, which is unrelated to the task of checking the top 5 trending movies currently in theaters. This indicates that the app may have redirected to a default page instead of the expected main interface.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 322, 'y': 2175}} | Description: Tapping the \"Movies\" icon in the bottom navigation bar to navigate to the section showing the top trending movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 473, 'y': 832}} | Description: Tapping on \"Moana 2 (2024)\" to access its detailed page and check its rating. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will navigate back to the previous screen to return to the list of trending movies. This will allow me to locate and tap on \"Wicked (2024)\" to access its detailed page and check its ratings. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The top trending movies currently in theaters are:   1. **Moana 2 (2024)**: PG, 1 hr 40 min, Opened Wed, Nov 27, 2024.    - Ratings: 62% (Tomatometer), 87% (Audience Score).   2. **Wicked (2024)**: PG, 2 hr 40 min, Opened Fri, Nov 22, 2024.    - Ratings: 88% (Tomatometer), 95% (Audience Score).    - Showtimes at Landmark Theatres Sunset: 12:40 PM, 4:00 PM.   3. **Kraven the Hunter (2024)**: R, 2 hr 7 min, Opened Fri, Dec 13, 2024.    - Ratings for \"Kraven the Hunter (2024)\" are not visible in the current screen.

The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 910, 'y': 2089}} | Description: Tapping the \"SKIP\" button to bypass the splash screen and proceed to the main interface of the Fandango app. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Tapping the \"SKIP\" button did not lead to the main interface of the Fandango app. Instead, it navigated to the \"My Orders\" page, which is unrelated to the task of checking the top 5 trending movies currently in theaters. This indicates that the app may have redirected to a default page instead of the expected main interface.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 322, 'y': 2175}} | Description: Tapping the \"Movies\" icon in the bottom navigation bar to navigate to the section showing the top trending movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 473, 'y': 832}} | Description: Tapping on \"Moana 2 (2024)\" to access its detailed page and check its rating. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will navigate back to the previous screen to return to the list of trending movies. This will allow me to locate and tap on \"Wicked (2024)\" to access its detailed page and check its ratings. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 461, 'y': 1257}} | Description: Tapping on \"Wicked (2024)\" to open its detailed page and view its ratings. This will allow me to compare its ratings with the other movies. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 322, 'y': 2175}} | Description: Tapping the \"Movies\" icon in the bottom navigation bar to navigate to the section showing the top trending movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 473, 'y': 832}} | Description: Tapping on \"Moana 2 (2024)\" to access its detailed page and check its rating. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will navigate back to the previous screen to return to the list of trending movies. This will allow me to locate and tap on \"Wicked (2024)\" to access its detailed page and check its ratings. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 461, 'y': 1257}} | Description: Tapping on \"Wicked (2024)\" to open its detailed page and view its ratings. This will allow me to compare its ratings with the other movies. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will navigate back to the previous screen to return to the list of trending movies. This will allow me to locate and tap on \"Kraven the Hunter (2024)\" to access its detailed page and view its ratings. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The top trending movies currently in theaters are:   1. **Moana 2 (2024)**: PG, 1 hr 40 min, Opened Wed, Nov 27, 2024.    - Ratings: 62% (Tomatometer), 87% (Audience Score).   2. **Wicked (2024)**: PG, 2 hr 40 min, Opened Fri, Nov 22, 2024.    - Ratings: 88% (Tomatometer), 95% (Audience Score).    - Showtimes at Landmark Theatres Sunset: 12:40 PM, 4:00 PM.   3. **Kraven the Hunter (2024)**: R, 2 hr 7 min, Opened Fri, Dec 13, 2024.    - Ratings: 15% (Tomatometer), 72% (Audience Score).    - Showtimes at AMC Century City 15: IMAX available, reserved seating, closed caption, accessibility devices available.   4. **[Other movies not yet identified]**  - **Wicked (2024)** has the highest ratings among the listed movies: 88% (Tomatometer) and 95% (Audience Score).  - Next step: Create a note for **Wicked (2024)** with its name and showtimes.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 473, 'y': 832}} | Description: Tapping on \"Moana 2 (2024)\" to access its detailed page and check its rating. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will navigate back to the previous screen to return to the list of trending movies.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen.

Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones: - The top trending movies currently in theaters are:   1. **Moana 2 (2024)**: PG, 1 hr 40 min, Opened Wed, Nov 27, 2024.    - Ratings: 62% (Tomatometer), 87% (Audience Score).   2. **Wicked (2024)**: PG, 2 hr 40 min, Opened Fri, Nov 22, 2024.    - Ratings: 88% (Tomatometer), 95% (Audience Score).    - Showtimes at Landmark Theatres Sunset: 12:40 PM, 4:00 PM.   3. **Kraven the Hunter (2024)**: R, 2 hr 7 min, Opened Fri, Dec 13, 2024.    - Ratings: 15% (Tomatometer), 72% (Audience Score).    - Showtimes at AMC Century City 15: IMAX available, reserved seating, closed caption, accessibility devices available.   4. **[Other movies not yet identified]**  - **Wicked (2024)** has the highest ratings among the listed movies: 88% (Tomatometer) and 95% (Audience Score).  - Next step: Create a note for **Wicked (2024)** with its name and showtimes.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - The top trending movies currently in theaters are:   1. **Moana 2 (2024)**: PG, 1 hr 40 min, Opened Wed, Nov 27, 2024.    - Ratings: 62% (Tomatometer), 87% (Audience Score).   2. **Wicked (2024)**: PG, 2 hr 40 min, Opened Fri, Nov 22, 2024.    - Ratings: 88% (Tomatometer), 95% (Audience Score).    - Showtimes at Landmark Theatres Sunset: 12:40 PM, 4:00 PM.   3. **Kraven the Hunter (2024)**: R, 2 hr 7 min, Opened Fri, Dec 13, 2024.    - Ratings: 15% (Tomatometer), 72% (Audience Score).    - Showtimes at AMC Century City 15: IMAX available, reserved seating, closed caption, accessibility devices available.   4. **[Other movies not yet identified]**  - **Wicked (2024)** has the highest ratings among the listed movies: 88% (Tomatometer) and 95% (Audience Score).  - Next step: Create a note for **Wicked (2024)** with its name and showtimes.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 461, 'y': 1257}} | Description: Tapping on \"Wicked (2024)\" to open its detailed page and view its ratings. This will allow me to compare its ratings with the other movies. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will navigate back to the previous screen to return to the list of trending movies. This will allow me to locate and tap on \"Kraven the Hunter (2024)\" to access its detailed page and view its ratings. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 571, 'y': 1937}} | Description: Tapping on \"Kraven the Hunter (2024)\" to open its detailed page and view its ratings. This will allow me to compare its ratings with the other movies. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: Returning to the home screen to locate and open the Notes app, where I will create a new note for **Wicked (2024)** with its name and showtimes. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Notes'}} | Description: I will open the Notes app to prepare for creating a new note for **Wicked (2024)** with its name and showtimes. Once the app is open, I will proceed to create the note. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Check some reviews on Lemon8 about the movie and create a note in Notes with the general sentiment.\n\n---\nCarefully reflect on the interaction history of the current task. Check if there are any subgoals that are accomplished by a sequence of successful actions and can be consolidated into new \"Shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions. For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",

When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.",
