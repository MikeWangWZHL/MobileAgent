0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the "X" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., "My Orders"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.  11. If an app opens an unintended interface (e.g., camera instead of Notes), return to the home screen and retry opening the correct app to avoid confusion.  12. When entering search terms, ensure the previous query is cleared completely to prevent appending incorrect text to the new query.  13. If a misaligned tap opens an unintended menu (e.g., Filters), close it immediately and retry the intended action.  14. Use broader search terms if specific queries fail to yield results, and refine the search gradually based on the context.  15. If an app fails to execute a search or action, consider switching to a browser or alternative app to complete the task.
