Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new horror movie information is visible in the current screenshot. The user should search specifically for horror movies in the Fandango app to identify the latest one currently in theaters.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Fandango'}} | Description: This action will open the Fandango app, allowing me to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new horror movie information is visible in the current screenshot. The user should search specifically for horror movies in the Fandango app to identify the latest one currently in theaters.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Fandango'}} | Description: This action will open the Fandango app, allowing me to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 352, 'y': 157, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies,\" and press Enter to search for horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search bar was tapped, and the text \"horror movies\" was expected to be entered and searched. However, the screen after the action does not show any search results for horror movies. Instead, it displays a general list of popular movies, which does not align with the expected behavior. This suggests that the search input was not processed or executed correctly.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[95, 42]; text: 7:49\n[483, 213]; text: ZIP CODE, MOVIE, OR THEATER\n[924, 245]; text: x\n[121, 250]; text: Y\n[384, 267]; text: horror movies\n[809, 507]; text: THEATERS\n[269, 510]; text: MOVIES\n[602, 659]; text: Annual Halloween Horror Movie\n[374, 716]; text: Marathon\n[629, 944]; text: 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie\n[372, 1000]; text: Marathon\n[617, 1228]; text: Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual\n[539, 1283]; text: DIY Horror Movie Contest\n[600, 1511]; text: Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2\n[599, 1795]; text: Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3\n[497, 2083]; text: Mystery Horror Movie\n[245, 2270]; text: III\n[851, 2271]; text: <\n[921, 243]; icon: The icon is a white circle with a red \"x\" in it, indicating a close or cancel action.\n[124, 251]; icon: This is an icon.\n[543, 2268]; icon: This is an icon.\n[964, 41]; icon: The Wi-Fi symbol is circular with white outline, while the signal strength indicator is rectangular with orange fill.\n[214, 42]; icon: The icon is a white circle with a black outline, depicting a subtraction sign.\n[926, 40]; icon: The Wi-Fi symbol is a white rectangle with two curved lines pointing to the right, inside a gray circle.\n[137, 735]; icon: This is an icon.\n[143, 41]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black outline, featuring two concentric circles with a heart symbol inside them.\n[269, 507]; icon: The Movies app logo on my iPhone has a white \"MOVIES\" text with a black background, displayed as a square-shaped icon.\n[847, 2268]; icon: The icon is shaped like an arrow pointing to the left, with a blue background and white outline.\n[136, 2112]; icon: The icon is square with rounded corners, filled with blue to white gradient.\n[137, 1020]; icon: This is an icon.\n[138, 1305]; icon: The app logo has three blue rectangles stacked on top of each other with rounded corners, all against a dark blue background.\n[167, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[138, 1590]; icon: The app logo has three blue rectangles stacked on top of each other with rounded corners, forming a triangle at the bottom.\n[138, 1873]; icon: This is an icon.\n[1010, 41]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, white in color, and depicts a battery symbol.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new horror movie information is visible in the current screenshot. The user should search specifically for horror movies in the Fandango app to identify the latest one currently in theaters. The current results appear to list events or older movies rather than the latest theatrical releases.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Fandango'}} | Description: This action will open the Fandango app, allowing me to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 352, 'y': 157, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies,\" and press Enter to search for horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search bar was tapped, and the text \"horror movies\" was expected to be entered and searched. However, the screen after the action does not show any search results for horror movies. Instead, it displays a general list of popular movies, which does not align with the expected behavior. This suggests that the search input was not processed or executed correctly.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 522, 'y': 245, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar at the top of the screen, type \"horror movies,\" and press Enter to search for horror movies currently in theaters. This should display the relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new horror movie information is visible in the current screenshot. The user should search specifically for horror movies in the Fandango app to identify the latest one currently in theaters. The current results appear to list events or older movies rather than the latest theatrical releases.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Fandango'}} | Description: This action will open the Fandango app, allowing me to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 352, 'y': 157, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies,\" and press Enter to search for horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search bar was tapped, and the text \"horror movies\" was expected to be entered and searched. However, the screen after the action does not show any search results for horror movies. Instead, it displays a general list of popular movies, which does not align with the expected behavior. This suggests that the search input was not processed or executed correctly.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 522, 'y': 245, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar at the top of the screen, type \"horror movies,\" and press Enter to search for horror movies currently in theaters. This should display the relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 924, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current search term, allowing me to refine the search for the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo new horror movie information is visible in the current screenshot. The user should search specifically for horror movies in the Fandango app to identify the latest one currently in theaters. The current results appear to list events or older movies rather than the latest theatrical releases.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Fandango'}} | Description: This action will open the Fandango app, allowing me to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 352, 'y': 157, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies,\" and press Enter to search for horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search bar was tapped, and the text \"horror movies\" was expected to be entered and searched. However, the screen after the action does not show any search results for horror movies. Instead, it displays a general list of popular movies, which does not align with the expected behavior. This suggests that the search input was not processed or executed correctly.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 522, 'y': 245, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar at the top of the screen, type \"horror movies,\" and press Enter to search for horror movies currently in theaters. This should display the relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 924, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current search term, allowing me to refine the search for the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'new horror movies in theaters'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"new horror movies in theaters,\" and press Enter to refine the search and display the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- No new horror movie information is visible in the current screenshot. - The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\" - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 352, 'y': 157, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies,\" and press Enter to search for horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search bar was tapped, and the text \"horror movies\" was expected to be entered and searched. However, the screen after the action does not show any search results for horror movies. Instead, it displays a general list of popular movies, which does not align with the expected behavior. This suggests that the search input was not processed or executed correctly.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 522, 'y': 245, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar at the top of the screen, type \"horror movies,\" and press Enter to search for horror movies currently in theaters. This should display the relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 924, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current search term, allowing me to refine the search for the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'new horror movies in theaters'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"new horror movies in theaters,\" and press Enter to refine the search and display the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 269, 'y': 510}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Movies\" tab to switch the view and potentially display the latest horror movies currently in theaters. This is necessary to refine the search results and proceed with identifying the latest horror movie. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[95, 43]; text: 7:52\n[483, 213]; text: ZIP CODE, MOVIE, OR THEATER\n[121, 250]; text: V\n[810, 506]; text: THEATERS\n[269, 510]; text: MOVIES\n[536, 1395]; text: No Movie results.\n[544, 2269]; text: O\n[242, 2270]; text: III\n[852, 2270]; text: <\n[921, 242]; icon: The microphone icon on the phone screen has a rounded square shape with black lines outlining it, indicating that it's currently turned off or inactive.\n[123, 250]; icon: The icon is shaped like an arrow pointing to the left, with blue fill color inside its white outline on a transparent background.\n[543, 2268]; icon: This is an icon.\n[964, 41]; icon: The Wi-Fi symbol is circular with white outline, while the signal strength indicator is rectangular with orange fill.\n[212, 42]; icon: The icon is a white horizontal line with two black dots on either end, and it represents subtraction or delete functionality.\n[847, 2268]; icon: The icon is shaped like an arrow pointing to the left, with a blue background and white outline.\n[166, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[269, 507]; icon: The Movies app logo on my iPhone has a white \"MOVIES\" text with a black background, displayed as a square-shaped icon.\n[142, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[809, 507]; icon: The icon is a white capital letter \"T\" with a black outline, giving it a simple yet distinctive appearance.\n[926, 40]; icon: The Wi-Fi symbol is a white rectangle with two curved lines pointing to the right, inside a gray circle.\n[95, 41]; icon: The time icon on the phone screen has a white background with black text displaying \"7:52\".\n[241, 2269]; icon: The icon has three horizontal lines, each with different shades of gray or black.\n[536, 1395]; icon: This is an icon.\n[992, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[1010, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[250, 263]; icon: The icon is shaped like a vertical blue line with rounded edges, filling the entire width of the screen.\n[592, 255]; icon: The icon is shaped like a microphone with a blue background and white text that reads \"ZIP CODE, MOVIE, OR THEATER\".\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- No new horror movie information is visible in the current screenshot.  - The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 522, 'y': 245, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar at the top of the screen, type \"horror movies,\" and press Enter to search for horror movies currently in theaters. This should display the relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 924, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current search term, allowing me to refine the search for the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'new horror movies in theaters'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"new horror movies in theaters,\" and press Enter to refine the search and display the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 269, 'y': 510}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Movies\" tab to switch the view and potentially display the latest horror movies currently in theaters. This is necessary to refine the search results and proceed with identifying the latest horror movie. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 246}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current search term, allowing me to refine the search with a broader query. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- No new horror movie information is visible in the current screenshot.  - The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 924, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current search term, allowing me to refine the search for the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'new horror movies in theaters'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"new horror movies in theaters,\" and press Enter to refine the search and display the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 269, 'y': 510}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Movies\" tab to switch the view and potentially display the latest horror movies currently in theaters.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The next step is to troubleshoot the lack of results by either adjusting the search query (e.g., specifying a ZIP code) or verifying the availability of horror movies in theaters.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nCorrect the search query on Fandango to \"horror movies near me\" with the ZIP code \"90210\" and check for results.\n\n### Screen Information ###\nThe attached image is a screenshot showing the current state of the phone. Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[96, 41]; text: 7:54\n[483, 213]; text: ZIP CODE, MOVIE, OR THEATER\n[924, 245]; text: x\n[121, 250]; text: Y\n[532, 264]; text: horror movi90210es near me\n[811, 509]; text: THEATERS\n[269, 510]; text: MOVIES\n[537, 1396]; text: No Theater results.\n[544, 2269]; text: O\n[242, 2270]; text: III\n[852, 2270]; text: <\n[921, 243]; icon: The icon is a white circle with a red outline, depicting a cross or \"X\" symbol.\n[124, 251]; icon: This is an icon.\n[543, 2268]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black border, and has two small dots inside representing app launchers on a smartphone home screen.\n[213, 42]; icon: The icon is\u5706\u5f62 (round) and\u9ed1\u8272 (black).\n[964, 41]; icon: The Wi-Fi symbol is a circle with three horizontal lines inside, colored white on a blue background; the signal strength indicator below it shows two out of five bars filled in gray.\n[847, 2268]; icon: This is an icon.\n[927, 41]; icon: The Wi-Fi symbol is composed of three lines stacked on top of each other, with two diagonal arrows pointing up and down at either end, all enclosed within a circle. The background color is white while the line colors vary between black or gray depending on whether it's connected to internet or not.\n[809, 507]; icon: This is an icon.\n[142, 42]; icon: The icon is circular, white with black outline, showing a clock face reading \"7:54\" and a heart symbol.\n[241, 2269]; icon: The icon has three horizontal lines, each with a slightly different shade of gray or black.\n[269, 507]; icon: The Movies app logo on my iPhone has a white \"MOVIES\" text with black background, outlined by a thin gray border.\n[167, 42]; icon: This is an icon.\n[95, 42]; icon: The time icon on the phone screen has a white background with black text that reads \"7:54\".\n[536, 1395]; icon: The icon is a white square with a black outline of a movie camera.\n[1010, 42]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners, white in color, and depicts two overlapping rings.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- No new horror movie information is visible in the current screenshot.  - The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'new horror movies in theaters'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"new horror movies in theaters,\" and press Enter to refine the search and display the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 269, 'y': 510}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Movies\" tab to switch the view and potentially display the latest horror movies currently in theaters. This is necessary to refine the search results and proceed with identifying the latest horror movie. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 246}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current search term, allowing me to refine the search with a broader query. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'horror movies near me'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies near me,\" and press Enter to refine the search and potentially display relevant results for horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 482, 'y': 240, 'text': '90210'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type the ZIP code \"90210\" (a commonly used ZIP code for testing), and press Enter to refine the search for horror movies currently in theaters in that area. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to refine the search by entering the ZIP code \"90210.\" However, the text entered into the search bar appears to have been appended incorrectly as \"horror movi90210es near me,\" which is not a valid query. This likely caused the search to fail, as indicated by the unchanged \"No Theater results\" message.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- No new horror movie information is visible in the current screenshot.  - The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 269, 'y': 510}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Movies\" tab to switch the view and potentially display the latest horror movies currently in theaters. This is necessary to refine the search results and proceed with identifying the latest horror movie. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 246}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current search term, allowing me to refine the search with a broader query. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'horror movies near me'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies near me,\" and press Enter to refine the search and potentially display relevant results for horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 482, 'y': 240, 'text': '90210'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type the ZIP code \"90210\" (a commonly used ZIP code for testing), and press Enter to refine the search for horror movies currently in theaters in that area. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to refine the search by entering the ZIP code \"90210.\" However, the text entered into the search bar appears to have been appended incorrectly as \"horror movi90210es near me,\" which is not a valid query. This likely caused the search to fail, as indicated by the unchanged \"No Theater results\" message.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 924, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the incorrect query, allowing me to re-enter the correct search term. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- No new horror movie information is visible in the current screenshot.  - The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:  - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon  - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon  - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest  - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2  - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3  - Mystery Horror Movie III\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 923, 'y': 246}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current search term, allowing me to refine the search with a broader query. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'horror movies near me'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies near me,\" and press Enter to refine the search and potentially display relevant results for horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 482, 'y': 240, 'text': '90210'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type the ZIP code \"90210\" (a commonly used ZIP code for testing), and press Enter to refine the search for horror movies currently in theaters in that area. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to refine the search by entering the ZIP code \"90210.\" However, the text entered into the search bar appears to have been appended incorrectly as \"horror movi90210es near me,\" which is not a valid query. This likely caused the search to fail, as indicated by the unchanged \"No Theater results\" message.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 924, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the incorrect query, allowing me to re-enter the correct search term. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies,\" and press Enter to perform a broader search for horror movies currently in theaters nationwide. This should provide relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note: Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here. Otherwise, keep the current plan and copy it here.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nThe next subgoal to work on. If the previous subgoal is not yet complete, copy it here. If all subgoals are completed, write \"Finished\".\n",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 482, 'y': 240, 'text': '90210'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type the ZIP code \"90210\" (a commonly used ZIP code for testing), and press Enter to refine the search for horror movies currently in theaters in that area. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action attempted to refine the search by entering the ZIP code \"90210.\" However, the text entered into the search bar appears to have been appended incorrectly as \"horror movi90210es near me,\" which is not a valid query. This likely caused the search to fail, as indicated by the unchanged \"No Theater results\" message.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 924, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the incorrect query, allowing me to re-enter the correct search term. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies,\" and press Enter to perform a broader search for horror movies currently in theaters nationwide. This should provide relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to open a browser or another app to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome app to perform a Google search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. This will help identify a specific movie to proceed with the task. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Its width and height are 1080 and 2340 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[95, 43]; text: 7:59\n[398, 161]; text: e\u3002 google.com/m?client\n[877, 158]; text: 0\n[738, 158]; text: \u5341\n[613, 320]; text: OpenAl\n[455, 702]; text: Former OpenAl researcher and\n[514, 775]; text: whistleblower found dead at age 26\n[194, 879]; text: CNBC\u00b71d\n[160, 1623]; text: 11 Signs\\\n[834, 1624]; text: Sharper Than\n[545, 1625]; text: Mentally\n[344, 1624]; text: You'rel\n[480, 1698]; text: An Average Person, According To\n[198, 1772]; text: Psychology\n[226, 1875]; text: YourTango\u00b71d\n[246, 2027]; text: Dark theme: on\n[714, 2030]; text: Privacy\n[901, 2029]; text: Terms\n[512, 2029]; text: Settings\n[339, 2128]; text: Advertising\n[581, 2127]; text: Business\n[781, 2128]; text: About\n[849, 2269]; text: <\n[319, 381]; icon: The logo is composed of six interlocking white circles set against a purple background, forming a flower-like pattern.\n[72, 880]; icon: This is an icon.\n[68, 158]; icon: The icon is a white house with a black roof, windows, and door on a blue background.\n[72, 1874]; icon: This is an icon.\n[876, 158]; icon: This is an icon.\n[896, 1367]; icon: The icon appears to be circular, with a dark red or maroon hue.\n[543, 2268]; icon: This is an icon.\n[736, 157]; icon: The icon is a white plus sign with rounded edges, set against a gray background.\n[964, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n[400, 156]; icon: The icon is shaped like a circle with a line through it, and has a white outline on a black background.\n[614, 317]; icon: The logo for OpenAI, which appears as white text against a purple background.\n[213, 42]; icon: The icon is\u5706\u5f62 (round) and\u9ed1\u8272 (black).\n[926, 41]; icon: The icon is a whiteWiFi symbol with two black arrows pointing up and down on either side, all set against a dark background.\n[167, 42]; icon: The icon is a heart symbol with a white outline on a red background, filled with gray shades to give it depth.\n[179, 158]; icon: The icon is circular, with two horizontal lines stacked on top of each other, colored black against a white background.\n[520, 344]; icon: This is an icon.\n[1010, 41]; icon: This is an icon.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 924, 'y': 245}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the incorrect query, allowing me to re-enter the correct search term. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies,\" and press Enter to perform a broader search for horror movies currently in theaters nationwide. This should provide relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to open a browser or another app to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome app to perform a Google search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. This will help identify a specific movie to proceed with the task. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 400, 'text': 'latest horror movie in theaters 2023'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movie in theaters 2023,\" and press Enter to perform the search. This should provide information about the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"latest horror movie in theaters 2023\" was supposed to be entered into the search bar, but the screen after the action shows no evidence of the query being typed or executed. The content on the screen remains unchanged, indicating that the action did not perform as expected.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 483, 'y': 213, 'text': 'horror movies'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"horror movies,\" and press Enter to perform a broader search for horror movies currently in theaters nationwide. This should provide relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to open a browser or another app to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome app to perform a Google search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. This will help identify a specific movie to proceed with the task. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 400, 'text': 'latest horror movie in theaters 2023'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movie in theaters 2023,\" and press Enter to perform the search. This should provide information about the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search query \"latest horror movie in theaters 2023\" was supposed to be entered into the search bar, but the screen after the action shows no evidence of the query being typed or executed. The content on the screen remains unchanged, indicating that the action did not perform as expected.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 400, 'text': 'latest horror movie in theaters 2023'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movie in theaters 2023,\" and press Enter to perform the search. This should provide relevant results about the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action to search for \"latest horror movie in theaters 2023\" did not produce the expected results. The screen after the action does not show any search results related to the query. Instead, it appears to have navigated to an unrelated page or failed to execute the search properly.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\" - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:  - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon  - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon  - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest  - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2  - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3  - Mystery Horror Movie III - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters. - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews. - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches. - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 400, 'text': 'latest horror movie in theaters 2023'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movie in theaters 2023,\" and press Enter to perform the search.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 400, 'text': 'latest horror movie in theaters 2023'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movie in theaters 2023,\" and press Enter to perform the search.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023. It is the first film in a planned trilogy of legacy sequels from the franchise.  - Other notable horror releases in October 2023 include \"The Nun II\" and \"Pet Cemetery: Bloodlines.\"  - The Lemon8 app is visible on the home screen and ready to be opened for searching reviews of \"The Exorcist: Believer.\"  - The action successfully activated the search bar in the Lemon8 app. The next step is to search for reviews of \"The Exorcist: Believer\" and summarize the general sentiment.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 396, 'y': 160, 'text': 'latest horror movie in theaters October 2023'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar, type \"latest horror movie in theaters October 2023,\" and press Enter to perform the search. This should provide updated and relevant results for the latest horror movies currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Lemon8 app to search for reviews of \"The Exorcist: Believer.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Lemon8'}} | Description: This action will open the Lemon8 app, enabling me to search for reviews of \"The Exorcist: Believer\" and summarize the general sentiment. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 322, 'y': 2140}} | Description: This action will tap the search icon in the Lemon8 app to activate the search bar, allowing me to search for reviews of \"The Exorcist: Believer.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 944, 'y': 138, 'text': 'The Exorcist: Believer reviews'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Lemon8 app, type \"The Exorcist: Believer reviews,\" and press Enter to search for reviews of the movie. This will allow me to gather information about the general sentiment of the reviews. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search bar in the Lemon8 app was tapped, but the text \"The Exorcist: Believer reviews\" was not entered, and the search was not executed. The screen remains focused on content related to \"college major advice,\" which was the previous search term.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023. It is the first film in a planned trilogy of legacy sequels from the franchise.  - Other notable horror releases in October 2023 include \"The Nun II\" and \"Pet Cemetery: Bloodlines.\"  - The Lemon8 app is visible on the home screen and ready to be opened for searching reviews of \"The Exorcist: Believer.\"  - The action successfully activated the search bar in the Lemon8 app. The next step is to search for reviews of \"The Exorcist: Believer\" and summarize the general sentiment.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Lemon8 app to search for reviews of \"The Exorcist: Believer.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Lemon8'}} | Description: This action will open the Lemon8 app, enabling me to search for reviews of \"The Exorcist: Believer\" and summarize the general sentiment. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 322, 'y': 2140}} | Description: This action will tap the search icon in the Lemon8 app to activate the search bar, allowing me to search for reviews of \"The Exorcist: Believer.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 944, 'y': 138, 'text': 'The Exorcist: Believer reviews'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Lemon8 app, type \"The Exorcist: Believer reviews,\" and press Enter to search for reviews of the movie. This will allow me to gather information about the general sentiment of the reviews. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search bar in the Lemon8 app was tapped, but the text \"The Exorcist: Believer reviews\" was not entered, and the search was not executed. The screen remains focused on content related to \"college major advice,\" which was the previous search term.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 999, 'y': 138}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current search term, \"college major advice,\" so that I can enter the new search term, \"The Exorcist: Believer reviews.\" | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Instead of clearing the search term \"college major advice\" in the search bar, the action opened the \"Filters\" menu. This indicates that the tap was misaligned and targeted the \"Filters\" icon instead of the \"X\" icon in the search bar.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023. It is the first film in a planned trilogy of legacy sequels from the franchise.  - Other notable horror releases in October 2023 include \"The Nun II\" and \"Pet Cemetery: Bloodlines.\"  - The Lemon8 app is visible on the home screen and ready to be opened for searching reviews of \"The Exorcist: Believer.\"  - The action successfully activated the search bar in the Lemon8 app. The next step is to search for reviews of \"The Exorcist: Believer\" and summarize the general sentiment.  - The \"Filters\" menu in the Lemon8 app has been successfully closed.  - The next step is to clear the search bar and search for \"The Exorcist: Believer reviews\" in the Lemon8 app.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Lemon8'}} | Description: This action will open the Lemon8 app, enabling me to search for reviews of \"The Exorcist: Believer\" and summarize the general sentiment. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 322, 'y': 2140}} | Description: This action will tap the search icon in the Lemon8 app to activate the search bar, allowing me to search for reviews of \"The Exorcist: Believer.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 944, 'y': 138, 'text': 'The Exorcist: Believer reviews'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Lemon8 app, type \"The Exorcist: Believer reviews,\" and press Enter to search for reviews of the movie. This will allow me to gather information about the general sentiment of the reviews. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search bar in the Lemon8 app was tapped, but the text \"The Exorcist: Believer reviews\" was not entered, and the search was not executed. The screen remains focused on content related to \"college major advice,\" which was the previous search term.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 999, 'y': 138}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current search term, \"college major advice,\" so that I can enter the new search term, \"The Exorcist: Believer reviews.\" | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Instead of clearing the search term \"college major advice\" in the search bar, the action opened the \"Filters\" menu. This indicates that the tap was misaligned and targeted the \"Filters\" icon instead of the \"X\" icon in the search bar.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 880, 'y': 141}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the top-right corner of the \"Filters\" menu to close it, allowing me to return to the main search interface and proceed with clearing the search bar. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023.

Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\nOpen_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\nTap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\nSwipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 944, 'y': 138, 'text': 'The Exorcist: Believer reviews'}} | Description: This action will tap the search bar in the Lemon8 app, type \"The Exorcist: Believer reviews,\" and press Enter to search for reviews of the movie. This will allow me to gather information about the general sentiment of the reviews. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The search bar in the Lemon8 app was tapped, but the text \"The Exorcist: Believer reviews\" was not entered, and the search was not executed.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023.

Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 881, 'y': 141}} | Description: This action will tap the \"X\" icon in the search bar to clear the current search term, \"college major advice,\" so that I can enter the new search term, \"The Exorcist: Believer reviews.\" | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Type', 'arguments': {'text': 'The Exorcist: Believer reviews'}} | Description: This action will type the search term \"The Exorcist: Believer reviews\" into the active search bar in the Lemon8 app. After this, I will execute the search by pressing Enter. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 944, 'y': 138}} | Description: This action will tap the \"Search\" button in the top-right corner of the screen to execute the search for \"Exorcist: Believer reviews\" in the Lemon8 app. This will display the relevant reviews for the movie. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 152, 'y': 584}} | Description: This action will tap on the post titled \"Do Not Disturb\" with a 5-star rating to analyze its content and determine the sentiment expressed in the review. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1170, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 234}} | Description: This action will swipe up to reveal more of the review content, allowing me to analyze the full text and confirm the sentiment expressed in the review. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023.

Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023.

When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023.

The movie is highly recommended for fans of possession films.\"}} | Description: This action will open the Notes app and create a new note containing the summarized sentiment of the review for \"The Exorcist: Believer.\" The note will reflect the positive feedback and recommendations from the review. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The expected behavior was to open the Notes app and create a new note summarizing the sentiment of the review. However, the screen after the action shows the camera interface instead of the Notes app or a new note. This indicates that the action did not execute as intended, and the Notes app was not opened.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1170, and y2 = 234 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n- Create_New_Note(text): Create a new note in the Notes app and type the provided text into it. | Precondition: The Notes app is open, and the 'Add' button (orange icon with a pencil) is visible on the screen.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Notes app to create a new note summarizing the sentiment of the review. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Create_New_Note', 'arguments': {'text': \"The review for 'The Exorcist: Believer' is highly positive.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- The search for \"new horror movies in theaters\" on Fandango returned \"No Movie results.\"  - The current search results on Fandango include events or marathons such as:   - Annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon   - 2nd Annual All-Night Horror Movie Marathon   - Guignolfest 2017: The 9th Annual DIY Horror Movie Contest   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 2   - Monday Nite TV Horror Movie 3   - Mystery Horror Movie III  - The user should refine the search criteria or verify the query to identify the latest horror movie currently in theaters.  - The Lemon8 app is available on the user's device for checking reviews.  - The Fandango app is also available on the user's device for further searches.  - As of October 2023, the latest horror movie in theaters is \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" released on October 6th, 2023.

Check if there are any subgoals that are accomplished by a sequence of successful actions and can be consolidated into new \"Shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions. For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.  1. By default, no apps are opened in the background.  2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.  3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.  4. When navigating apps, ensure that the correct icon is tapped by carefully identifying its position and function to avoid misalignment or unintended actions.  5. If a search filter is applied unintentionally, clear it by tapping the \"X\" icon in the search bar before proceeding with a new search.  6. Always verify the context of the search results to ensure they align with the intended query before summarizing or proceeding to the next step.  7. When recording information in Notes, ensure the formatting is clear and consistent for easy readability.  8. Double-check the accuracy of the recorded information (e.g., account names, titles) before saving the note to avoid errors.  9. If redirected to an unintended page (e.g., \"My Orders\"), navigate back to the main interface or intended section before proceeding.  10. When comparing multiple items (e.g., movie ratings), keep track of all relevant data to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid revisiting the same pages unnecessarily.\n\n### Full Action History ###\n- Action: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Fandango'}} | Description: This action will open the Fandango app, allowing me to search for the latest horror movie currently in theaters. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The Fandango app has been successfully opened.
